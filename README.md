## Documentation

Documentation specifically relevant to people working on the codebase is stored as Markdown pages in [/docs](./docs). These pages are rendered by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and automatically deployed by GitHub Actions whenever a new change is merged into the main branch. The deployed docs live in the `gh-pages` branch.

You can serve the website locally by running `npm run docs` and visiting `http://localhost:8000`. This allows you to verify the rendering of your built docs before merging.

To make configuration updates to mkdocs or the deployment workflow, see [mkdocs.yml](./mkdocs.yml) and [docs-deploy.yml](./.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml).

## Developer Setup

When initially setting up the project, install packages from the repo root to enable git hooks and linting.

```
npm install
```

To ensure Terraform (infra) files are linted, install Terraform. The best way to manage Terraform versions is with [Terraform Version Manager](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv).

```
$ brew install tfenv
$ tfenv install 0.14.7
```

## Portal

### Prerequisites

Node v10 (or greater)

### Run Instructions

Run the web portal locally from the project root directory with the following commands:

```
npm install --prefix portal
npm run dev --prefix portal
```

### Additional commands

#### `npm run lint`

Run all linters. Fixes any [auto-fixable ESLint errors](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) and formats the Terraform files.

[Integrate ESLint into your IDE or a git hook](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) if you'd like to catch linting errors before it reaches the CI.

#### `npm run lint:ci`

Runs all linters and fails on errors. Does not attempt to auto-fix ESLint errors.

#### `npm run lint:js`

Lint JS files using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

#### `npm run prettier`

Automatically format files using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
