# In aws-amplify-react (v3.x), it imports a CSS file from its JS file.
# This breaks server-side rendering in Next.js. It can be resolved with
# a Webpack hack, but that introduces its own issues with React hooks.
# https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/3854
#
# This script is intendend to be ran after `npm install`, and it removes
# the offending lines from aws-amplify-react.
#
# TODO (https://lwd.atlassian.net/browse/CP-231): This script becomes irrelvant
# once the following PR is released, which should happen in v4.x of the library.
# (It shouldn't break anything if it's not removed though).
