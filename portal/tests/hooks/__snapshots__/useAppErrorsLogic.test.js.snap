    Why you are seeing this error:
  </strong>
   Your employee told us about some other leave and benefits they are receiving in addition to paid leave from PFML. This information was added to their application recently. In some cases, when an employee who submitted an application before July 15th then adds other leave and benefits information later, it can cause this error.
  <p>
    This is a rare error that will not happen with new applications.
