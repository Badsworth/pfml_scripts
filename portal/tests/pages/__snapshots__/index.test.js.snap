      Step one: Tell your employer that you need to take Paid Family and Medical Leave. 
    </Heading>
    <p>
      If you can, tell your employer at least 30 days before your leave begins. If you need to take leave right away, tell your employer as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you tell your employer, you have the right to apply and your job is protected. Keep a record of what date you notified your employer. You will need to provide this date in your leave application.
