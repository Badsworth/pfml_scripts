        Respond to applications within 10 business days
      </Heading>
      <p>
        When an application is submitted, you have 10 business days to open the direct link from your email and review it online. You can comment on the application, approve or deny it, and report fraud if needed. Reviewing takes about 10 minutes. If we don’t hear from anyone at your company before the deadline, we’ll process the application solely based on the information the employee provided.
