                Once your application is approved, you can expect your first payment to arrive at the beginning of your fourth week of leave, if your leave has already started.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your leave starts in the future, you can expect your first payment 2-4 weeks after your leave starts.
              </p>
              <p>
                After that, you will receive your payments every week.
