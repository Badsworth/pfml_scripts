        Next, we need to know about paid time off from your employer that you plan to use between January 1, 2022 and June 1, 2022. This includes paid vacation time, sick time, personal time, and other paid time off provided by your employer. You do not need to tell us about short or long-term disability programs, or other family or medical leave benefits provided by your employer in this section. We’ll ask about that in the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your PFML leave begins, there is a 7-day waiting period before PFML payments start. During this 7-day waiting period, you can use paid time off from your employer with no impact to your PFML benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the 7-day waiting period, 
        <strong>
          you cannot use both employer-sponsored paid time off and paid leave from PFML on the same day.
        </strong>
         In some cases, using accrued paid leave after the 7-day waiting period has ended can cause your PFML benefits to stop. You will need to re-apply to receive PFML benefits again. To avoid this, use accrued paid leave only at the start or end of your PFML leave.
