      1. Tell your employer that you need to take paid leave

    <p>
      If you can, tell your employer at least 30 days before your leave begins. If you need to take leave right away, tell your employer as soon as possible.

      Once you tell your employer, you have the right to apply and your job is protected. Make a note of when you notified your employer. You will need to provide this date in your leave application.
