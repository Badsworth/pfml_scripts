          What is a benefit year?
        </summary>
        <div

          <p>
            The benefit year is a period of 52 weeks that starts on the Sunday before when you first miss work for a qualifying reason. You are entitled to up to 20 weeks of medical leave, 12 weeks of family leave, or 26 weeks for a combination of both during a single benefit year.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can submit an application for leave that crosses into a new benefit year. We will review the request as if it is two separate applications. The Department's determination for one application may be different from its determination for the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: The first time you took leave for a qualifying reason began on Thursday, April 1, 2021. The benefit year began on the Sunday before, which is March 28, 2021. The benefit year lasts 52 weeks and ends on Saturday, which is March 26, 2022.
