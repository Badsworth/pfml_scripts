        Once your payments have started, expect to be paid weekly for the duration of your leave.

        <strong>
          What may cause a delayed payment
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact day you receive payment can be delayed because of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          State and federal holidays
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave periods that end on weekends
        </li>
        <li>
          Your bank’s processes
        </li>
        <li>
          The process to adjust your benefit amount due to additional income or benefits you or your employer reported
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes to your leave’s start and end dates
        </li>
        <li>
          Other processing issues such as issues with bank account information, or your address
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>
          What may cause a cancelled payment
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Payments can be canceled due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changes to when you end your leave
        </li>
        <li>
          Paid time off taken on days you also receive PFML benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
          The process to adjust your benefit amount due to additional income or benefits you or your employer reported may temporarily create a canceled payment
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          You or your employer report additional other leave, income or benefits
