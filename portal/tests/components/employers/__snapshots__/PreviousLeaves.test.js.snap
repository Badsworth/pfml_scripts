    Your employee has listed leave they have taken for a qualified reason. Only leave since January 1, 2021 is included. This includes both paid leave, such as paid vacation or sick days, and unpaid leave, such as FMLA leave. When possible, verify that a previous leave was for a reason that qualifies for paid leave under PFML.
