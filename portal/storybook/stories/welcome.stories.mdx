This is a Storybook for the [Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave](https://paidleave.mass.gov) claimant and employer&nbsp;portals.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for UI development and collaboration. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can preview entire UIs without needing to run the Portal application, or navigating around the Portal flow.

**[Read more about the process and collaboration goals behind our usage of Storybook here](https://github.com/EOLWD/pfml/blob/main/docs/portal/storybook.md).**
