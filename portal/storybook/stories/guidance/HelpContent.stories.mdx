## Details Component

**When to use the details component:**

- Content that applies to a specific subset of users _and_ is not critical to correctly answering the question
- When there is a _single_ section of content

**When to not use the details component:**

- Defining terminology that is critical to answering the question
- When there are _multiple_ sections of content - this content should be either:
  - Included in the hint text
  - In an accordion or tab component
- Avoid hiding content using the details component except when absolutely necessary for content on the page that applies to a specific subset of users

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Details">
    <Details label="When will I get paid?">
      Once your application is approved, you can expect your first payment to
      arrive at the beginning of your fourth week of leave, if your leave has
      already started. If your leave starts in the future, you can expect your
      first payment 2-4 weeks after your leave starts. After that, you will
      receive your payments every week.
    </Details>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Supporting Information

Supporting information provides additional context after the main question. This form of help content maps to the body/lead style in our design system. It's used to provide the user supporting information that is necessary for taking action.

**When to use supporting information**

- If there are constraints based on the selected answer option.
  - For example:
    - On the Leave Reason page explaining that only one leave type can be requested at a time
- Defining program terminology which is critical for the user to understand in order to take action.
  - For example:
    - Defining a qualifying leave reason for past leave in both the claimant portal application and leave admin review process
    - Defining potential fraud in the leave admin review process

**When to not use supporting information**

- If the primary content is straightforward and contains all the information someone needs to take action.
  - For example:
    - yes/no questions, like on the State ID page.
- Explaining technical or program limitations. This information should be called out in a summary or info alert.
  - For example: - Currently unavailable leave types or file upload limitations

<Canvas>
  <Story name="LeaveReason">
    <FormLabel hint="You can only request one leave at a time.">
      Why do you need to take leave?
    </FormLabel>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Hint Text

Hint text is help content that expands on specific answer options. This form of help content uses the default body/regular type size and grey styling.

Use hint text when adding additional context for answer options.

- For example: Identifying which radio option is medical or family leave when selecting a leave reason

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Hint">
    <form className="usa-form">
      <h2>Why do you need to take leave?</h2>
      <InputChoice
        hint="Medical Leave"
        label="I can’t work due to an illness, injury, or pregnancy."
        name="radioFieldName"
        type="radio"
        value="medical"
      />
      <InputChoice
        hint="Family Leave"
        label="I need to bond with my child after birth, adoption, or foster placement."
        name="radioFieldName"
        type="radio"
        value="family"
      >
        Radio
      </InputChoice>
    </form>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Summary Box

A summary box can be used to highlight 3-5 points from more dense content, or outline specific steps or a checklist. This help component calls visual attention to information on the page without using an alert or hiding content in a details component.

**When to use a summary box.**

Use a summary box for content that is meant to guide the user through technical limitations.

- For example: Calling out document requirements.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="SummaryBox">
    <DocumentRequirements type="id" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
