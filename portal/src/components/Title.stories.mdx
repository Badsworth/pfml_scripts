## Section titles

On question pages, the Title should be displayed with the `small` varient, also called
a "section title." These are often repeated across question pages to help users understand
where they are in the form and contextualize the questions.

  <Story name="Small">
    <Title small>Tell us about yourself</Title>
  </Story>

## HTML Legend as page title

Some question pages may only have a single question, where it may make since to have
the question itself as the page title. In this case, the HTML element used for
rendering the title should be changed in order for the page to remain semantic,
maintaining the association between the question and the input fields.
