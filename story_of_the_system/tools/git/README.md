# Git

### Git Description
Git is a code versioning tool we use for that purpose.

### Our Use Cases for Git

We use Git to clone the `pfml` repository to make impermanent changes to its code and submit these changes for review. 

### Accessing Git

1. Technical requirements 
    - [Git can be used on any system][GIT] and is most often used via the command-line interface.
2. Authentication requirements
    - While Git can be used without authentication, it must be [setup to authenticate with GitHub][SSH] to be useful for our application. 
3. Administrative requirements (if any)
    - No administrative requirements must be fulfilled to download and use this tool; however, Git access to the codebase must be accomplished by adding the EOLWD account/organization to your existing GitHub account. This will be discussed in the GitHub tool section.
