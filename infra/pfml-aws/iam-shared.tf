# Set up policies for deployments that are shared between developers and CI.
#
# We manage this through terraform to:
# 1) allow developers to request access changes themselves.
# 2) document why they needed the additional access.
#
# For developers:
#   If you need additional access, please create a PR
#   with your reasoning and use cases.
#
# For full-access AWS admins:
#   Once the changes are merged, you must run the changes
#   manually with your elevated role.
