# Sets up a user and access policy role for CI/CD.
#
# The "pfml-github-actions" user itself has no permissions, but can assume the ci-run-deploys role along
# with PFML admins and developers. This allows us to easily test whether CI has all the read and write
# permissions it needs without having the long-term pfml-github-actions user credentials on our machines.
#
# This is particularly important because developers receive full read-only access by default, and
# pfml-github-actions does not.
#
# For PFML admins and developers that want to assume the role (i.e. pretend to be github actions),
# see the infra/README.md for details.
#
# Access for the role covers the following:
# - full access to services used by our applications.
# - full access to IAM, except for roles and users that were given to us by EOTSS.
#
# Most of this access comes from iam-shared.tf.
#
# To set up Github Actions, you'll need to apply these changes and then go to the AWS console
# and create credentials for the new user (access key ID and secret key). This should then
# be sent to a Github repo admin who has access to pfml > Settings.
