# Infrastructure

This directory houses the configuration needed for maintaining PFML infrastructure.
We use [Terraform](https://terraform.io) to manage our infra in a modular, concise, and reusable fashion and Github Actions to automatically deploy infrastructure.

## First-time Setup

For first-time setup, see [docs/infra/first-time-setup.md](../docs/infra/first-time-setup.md).

## Directory Structure

This directory contains three standalone modules:

- `constants` provide shared values for other terraform modules.
- `pfml-aws` is account-level infrastructure that must be manually deployed by an infra-admin.
- `monitoring` is monitoring infrastructure that is automatically deployed when changed in the main branch.

```
└── constants           🏡 infrastructure data shared across all applications and all environments, e.g. a common block of aws tags

└── pfml-aws            🏡 infrastructure for AWS and VPCs, shared across envs e.g. machine IAM users,
                           docker registries, and network load balancers for each VPC.

└── monitoring          🏡 configuration for pagerduty schedules, on-call policies, and New Relic/Cloudwatch alerts.
```

Additionally, we have several components that are duplicated within each environment:

```
└── api                 🏡 infrastructure for a PFML api environment
    └── template        🏗  shared template for api env
    └── environments
        └── test        ⛱  test env, deployed on every merged commit.
        └── stage       ⛱  staging env
        └── prod        ⛱  production env

└── ecs-tasks           🏡 infrastructure for background PFML API ECS tasks
    └── template        🏗  shared template for API ecs tasks
    └── environments

└── env-shared          🏡 infrastructure for an environment, shared across applications e.g. an API Gateway and ECS cluster.
    └── template        🏗  shared template for an env
    └── environments

└── portal              🏡 infrastructure for a PFML portal environment
    └── template        🏗  shared template for portal env
    └── environments
```

Several re-usable modules have also been created for use by the terraform folders above:

```
└── modules                  🏡 reusable modules.
    └──  ecs_task_scheduler  ⛱ Creates a scheduled ECS task job.
    └──  s3_ecs_trigger      ⛱ Creates an ECS task triggered by S3 events
    └──  alarms_api          ⛱ Creates alarms for the API application in a given environment.
    └──  alarms_portal       ⛱ Creates alarms for the Portal application in a given environment.
    └──  ...
```

## Runbook

To view pending changes to infrastructure within an environment directory (i.e. `/test`, `/stage`):

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
```

To apply changes to infrastructure:

```
$ terraform apply
```

### Running JS Lambda Tests

To run the [test suite](../docs/tests.md):

```
npm test
```

Update _all_ [Jest snapshots](../docs/tests.md#Snapshot%20tests), accepting any updates as expected changes:

```
npm run test:update-snapshot
```

Run the project's test suite in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```

> By default, this will attempt to identify which tests to run based on which files have changed in the current repository. After running, you can interact with the prompt to configure or filter which test files are ran.
