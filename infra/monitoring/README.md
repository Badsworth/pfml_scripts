# Monitoring

Application monitors and alerts are managed via Terraform in this folder. This folder accounts for monitoring across all environments and is automatically deployed when changes are merged into the main branch.

For more details about making and testing changes, please see [../../docs/infra/making-changes-to-alerts.md].
