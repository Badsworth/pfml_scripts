# NOTE: This file is intended to be run within a temporary terraform workspace.
#
#   This is useful when you need to test changes to the resources in a dedicated
#   environment that won't be wiped out. The API Gateway will point to the API
#   in the test environment, although you can change this by switching the nlb_port
#   to whatever is configured in infra/api/environments/ENV/main.tf.
#
#   CORS might get in the way though.
#
#   Naming: do not use underscores, slashes, or other odd characters.
#
#   Usage:
#     terraform workspace new <your-helpful-name>
#     terraform plan / apply etc
#
#   Cleanup:
#     terraform destroy.
#     terraform workspace delete <your-helpful-name>
#
#   Listing all workspaces:
#     terraform workspace list
