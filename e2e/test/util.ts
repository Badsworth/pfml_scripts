/*
  @Note: Parts of the test are commented out due to functionality not being ready
  for testing.  Once feature is ready for testing we'll remove comments.

  We can uncomment uploads when NAVA API team has completed implementation
  for the new API upload using multipart: https://lwd.atlassian.net/browse/PORTAL-1390

  This file also contains other util functions/variables specifically for integration tests
