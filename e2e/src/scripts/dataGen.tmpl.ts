/**
 * @summary
 *
 * This is a data generation script, roughly consisting of three parts:
 *   1. Employer generation
 *   2. Employee generation
 *   3. Claim generation
 *
 * Clone this file to make a new script. Before use, take note of all @todo items listed below.
 *
 * NB. This script is "idempotent"â€”if you run it multiple times, nothing bad happens.
 * Since we check if file exists each time, we may rerun this many times without overwriting existing data.
 *
 * @todo After customizing this script, you can generate the data by running:
 *   ```
 *     npx ts-node [PATH/TO/DATA_GEN_SCRIPT.ts]`
 *   ```
 *
 * By default, the resulting data will be placed within the `/data` directory at the project root.
 *
 * @todo After generating the data, follow-up steps may include:
 *   1. Upload the resulting DOR files to the appropriate S3 bucket based on the desired environment;
 *   2. After the employers are loaded into FINEOS, register Leave Admins for the employers by running:
 *     ```
 *       E2E_ENVIRONMENT=ENV_NAME npm run cli -- simulation registerAllLeaveAdmins [-f PATH/TO/employers.json]
 *     ```
 *   2a. To register a single Leave Admin at a time, use the following command instead:
 *     ```
 *       npm run cli -- simulation register-leave-admin [FEIN] [WITHHOLDING_AMOUNT]
 *     ```
 *   3. Submit the generated claims by running:
 *     ```
 *       npm run cli -- simulation submit <PATH/TO/CLAIMS_DIRECTORY> [--cooldown] [--concurrency number] [--errorLimit number]
 *     ```
 *   3a. If the claims have `postSubmit` steps, then Leave Admins must be registered before claim submission.
