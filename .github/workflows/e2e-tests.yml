#
# This workflow actually runs E2E tests: Cypress and Jest.
#
# It is a "reusable" workflow, meaning it can only be triggered as part of another workflow.
# It runs tests in parallel, and tests are split into four categories:
#   * Stable - tests that must pass before release.
#   * Unstable - tests that are advisory (for upcoming features) and should not block release.
#   * Ignored - tests that are not run at all in CI.
#   * Morning - tests that run to check features are working correctly.

# This name shouldn't matter, as it isn't displayed. We add "ZZ" to make it float to the bottom
# of the workflows list in case it somehow gets triggered directly.
