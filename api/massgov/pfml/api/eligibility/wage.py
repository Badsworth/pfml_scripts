          prior to 2 quarters before the effective date.

       2. Determine within the base period the number of quarters where wages have been reported (N)

        If N >= 3, then:

            Take the 2 quarters with the highest earnings, and sum them all
            Divide the total by 26

        If N <= 2, then:

            Take the highest quarter of total wages
