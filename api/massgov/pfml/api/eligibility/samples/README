This directory contains sample payloads for the financial eligibility API.

The payloads assume that data generated using the DOR generator is used.

To use, generate and import fake DOR data:

  make dor-generate
  make dor-import

Create a user with the FINEOS role:

  make create-user args=fineos

Get a JWT for that user:

  make jwt auth_id=<UUID from sub_id attribute>

Run the API calls:

  TOKEN=<JWT token from above> ./run_all.sh
