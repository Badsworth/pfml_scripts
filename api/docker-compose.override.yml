# Default override file for local development. This is used by default
# alongside docker-compose.yml when running docker-compose without -f flags.
#
# This is split from the normal docker-compose.yml file in order to support
# docker-compose.release.yml, which runs the release build locally. Instead
# of usiing the development files, it prebuilds the python wheel, so the
# /app directory should not be overridden.

    # We set `:z` on the bind mounts to support Linux systems with SELinux, on
    # other platforms it has no effect.
