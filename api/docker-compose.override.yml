# Default override file for local development. This is used by default
# alongside docker-compose.yml when running docker-compose without -f flags.
#
# This is split from the normal docker-compose.yml file in order to support
# docker-compose.release.yml, which runs the release build locally. Instead
# of usiing the development files, it prebuilds the python wheel, so the
# /app directory should not be overridden.

    # We set `:z` on the bind mounts to support Linux systems with SELinux, on
    # other platforms it has no effect.

      # To make local development easier, mount project code so that we don't
      # have to rebuild the docker container every time we run

      # You can make your aws credentials accessible in the container by
      # uncommenting this line with the path to your aws credentials folder.
      #
      # - $HOME/.aws:/home/${RUN_USER:-nodummy}/.aws:ro
      #
      # On mac/linux, this will generally be your home directory.
      # If not, you'll need to change the line above.
      #
      # Example usage:
      # 1. Log into AWS:
      #    $ aws sso login
      #
      # 2. Update AWS_PROFILE in docker-compose.yml. e.g.
      #    - AWS_PROFILE=eolwd-pfml-infrastructure-admin-498823821309
      #
      # 3. Restart container
      #    $ make stop && make start
      #
      # 4. Run whatever you need.
      #    $ make runcmd cmd="payments-ctr-process ..."
