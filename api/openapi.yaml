      description: >
        Supports partial update of an Application record.

        Note that array property updates are not partial, after processing the
        PATCH, the Application state will contain only the values of the array
        in the request.

        The behavior generally follows RFC 7396.

        It is expected clients will call this endpoint multiple times and with
        incomplete data as individual pieces of information is collected from
        the user. The API will review the data provided and return any pertinent
        warnings or errors.
