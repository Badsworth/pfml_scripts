Below are guidelines for working once you're ready. Commit in your own branch, and include your name in the branch name, e.g. lorenyu/pfml-123-new-feature . Try to keep commits small and focused on one thing. If you find yourself using \u201cand\u201d and \u201calso\u201d in your title or description, that may be a sign to break things up into smaller chunks. You can selectively git add files or use the interactive option: git add -p . Note that after a PR is merged, your commit message history will be squashed and rewritten. Your local commit history will persist on the PR's page unless you force-push a squashed version of the branch. Informative commit messages can help when context-switching between branches, or for PR clarity in larger PRs. See Seven Rules for an external reference on commit message best practices. To keep your branch updated with others' changes, you can: Rebase your changes onto main with git rebase main , or Merge main onto your own branch: git merge main . The favored pathway to keep your branch updated is to use git merge main. It's still possible to rebase and force-push your branch using git rebase main , but this pathway should be avoided if your branch is being worked on by more than one person at a time, due to the risk of causing unnecessary conflicts. Code Owners Many parts of the code have owners, defined in the CODEOWNERS file . Code owners help to improve the quality of the code by: - Reviewing changes (see below) - Encouraging consistency and maintainability - Refactoring the code as it grows Normally each module or file has two or more owners that share these tasks. Code Reviews Code reviews are intended to help all of us grow as engineers and improve the quality of what we ship. These guidelines are meant to reinforce those two goals. For authors or requesters: Include the JIRA ticket number in the title. For example: PFML-123: Implement API endpoint . Every change should have an associated JIRA ticket unless it is a documentation change. A single JIRA ticket may be associated with multiple pull requests. If it is a documentation change, please prefix with docs: docs: Clean up CONTRIBUTING.md . Include a GitHub label if relevant. These labels can be a helpful wayfinding and context building tool, especially for new engineers onboarding into the codebase. The architecture label should be used for changes to abstractions or interfaces that usually affect multiple existing files. The pattern label should be used for a new structure or interface that will be reused later. The operations label should be used for changes to engineering operations, such as dev set-up or deployment. If your PR is a work-in-progress, or if you are looking for specific feedback on things, create a Draft Pull Request and state what you are looking for in the description. Your PR should be small enough that a reviewer can reasonably respond within 1 business day. For larger changes, break them down into a series of PRs. If refactors are included in your changes, try to split them out as recommended below. As a PR writer, you should consider your description and comments as documentation; current and future team members will refer to it to understand your design decisions. Include relevant context and business requirements, and add preemptive comments (in code or PR) for sections of code that may be confusing or worth debate. When you're ready to request a review, consider including folks who are less familiar with that part of the codebase. This allows others to see what you're working on, along with your development/communication style and ways of working. Once you've received feedback, acknowledge each comment with a response or code change. For reviewers: Aim to respond to code reviews within 1 business day. Remember to highlight things that you like and appreciate while reading through the changes, and to make any other feedback clearly actionable by indicating if it is optional preference, an important consideration, or an error. Don't be afraid to comment with a question, or to ask for clarification, or provide a suggestion, whenever you don\u2019t understand what is going on at first glance \u2014 or if you think an approach or decision can be improved. Code reviews give us a chance to learn from one another, and to reflect, iterate on, and document why certain decisions are made. Once you're ready to approve or request changes, err on the side of trust. Send a vote of approval if the PR looks ready except for small minor changes, and trust that the recipient will address your comments before merging by replying via comment or code to any asks. Use \"request changes\" sparingly, unless there's a blocking issue or major refactors that should be done. Auto assignment Code review assignment can be setup to occur automatically when a Pull Request is created, through a combination of the CODEOWNERS file and GitHub teams . Teams exist for the API and Portal engineers: API engineers: @pfml-api Portal engineers: @pfml-portal The Portal engineering team is configured so that PR reviews are automatically assigned to a member of the team via a round robin algorithm, with the goal of equally distributing PR reviews across the team. Since the Portal engineering team includes those working on either the Claimant Portal or Employer Portal, PR reviews are distributed between both groups. The API team has configured code owners for slices of the codebase in the CODEOWNERS file . These code owners will be automatically assigned when the relevant code paths are edited. Pull Request Titles Please title Pull Requests in GitHub as \"API-nnn: summary\", \"CP-nnn: summary\", etc. For tickets that have subtasks, use the parent ticket's id in the title, and include the subtask in the PR description. When making a fix with no ticket, please use \"API: summary\" or \"Portal: summary\". This makes it easier to search for PRs and also links JIRA tickets to GitHub PRs automatically. Merging a PR How to merge When merging a PR, use the PR description as a starting point. Copy it into the merge commit body and clean it up as desired. Please verify that the commit title includes the JIRA ticket. Example: PFML-540: Implement GET claims endpoint (#145) https://jira.cms.gov/browse/PFML-540 Implements /claims endpoint which is a GET that takes a valid user ID and returns their first claim from the database. Demo: Unit tests and adhoc testing via swagger UI. When to merge A PR should only be merged when all its automated checks have returned green and when the PR has received at least one approval. Although GitHub does not block the merge of a PR that fails its checks, any failed checks should be treated as a blocking issue and resolved before the PR is merged. Merges & the API database A particular source of danger when merging a PR is the risk that the merge will introduce conflicts to the PFML API's database schema. This scenario is not uncommon, especially for branches that introduce new database migrations and that have not yet been updated with the latest changes to main. The API's test suite cannot detect these conflicts, so they have historically been discovered only after PR merge, when deployment of the API begins to fail. To mitigate this risk, any engineer who introduces new database migrations to the API should pay special attention to the \"Pre-Merge Conflict Check\", an automated check that should appear on any pull request that makes changes to api/massgov/pfml/db/migrations/versions . This special 'pseudo-check' will diff your branch against main, and fail if it detects that your branch is missing any database migrations that are already present on main. To mitigate the risk that updates to main will, occasionally, introduce new database conflicts to unmerged branches, this pseudo-check will automatically re-run itself whenever a new database migration is pushed to main, and additionally whenever new commits are pushed to your PR's feature branch. For these reasons, please make sure you check the status of any database conflicts before merging an approved PR. To avoid these conflicts, any PR that alters the database must be updated with the latest changes to main before being merged.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#delivery-workflow","text":"Please see the Delivery Workflow Confluence page for guidance on how to pick up tickets, when to deploy, which environment to deploy to, etc.","title":"Delivery Workflow"},{"location":"contributing/#local-development","text":"For practical instructions on getting set up locally, see the repo README .

Validation should only serve to help prevent incorrect data (typos, etc) not prevent ineligible applications . We should be careful not to accidentally deny a claimant\u2019s right to an appeal or otherwise make the system less flexible than it needs to be as is so often the case with government systems. Adding validation rules Validation rules currently are enforced at three different layers: OpenAPI generally enforces a subset of rules on individual fields Pydantic models enforce some business rules on individual fields Custom code enforces presence of required fields or rules requiring context of multiple fields OpenAPI OpenAPI is the first layer a request flows through, and enforces a subset of validation rules: type format pattern enum For all endpoints, these validations always result in a 400 status code with errors when a rule is not fulfilled. These validations are located in the openapi.yml spec file. Why we avoid OpenAPI's required property To display a user friendly internationalized error message to Portal users, the error must include the field that is missing and a consistent type . For example: { \"errors\" : [ { \"field\" : \"password\" , \"type\" : \"required\" } ] } OpenAPI pitfalls: The main deal breaker is when using the OpenAPI's required property, the error response doesn't return the name of the specific field that is missing . It just returns the full array of fields that are required. This prevents Portal from displaying a useful error message. Some endpoints are split across multiple pages in the Portal so it will be expected that not all required fields are present at once in a request. Pydantic field validator Individual fields on a Pydantic model can have custom validation logic to enforce business rules or reality checks (e.g a birthdate must be in the past).

If you are new to pytest, reading up on how fixtures work in particular might be helpful as it's one area that is a bit different than is common with other runners (and languages). Naming pytest automatically discovers tests by following a number of conventions (what it calls \"collection\"). For this project specifically: All tests live under tests/ Under tests/ , the organization mirrors the source code structure, but without the massgov/pfml/ part, so for example: The tests for massgov/pfml/api/ live under tests/api/ massgov/pfml/util/aws/ under test/util/aws/ . Create __init__.py files for each directory. This helps avoid name conflicts when pytest is resolving tests . Test files should begin with the test_ prefix, followed by the module the tests cover, for example, a file foo.py will have tests in a file test_foo.py . Tests for massgov/pfml/api/applications.py live at tests/api/test_applications.py Test cases should begin with the test_ prefix, followed by the function it's testing and some description of what about the function it is testing. In tests/api/test_users.py , the test_users_patch_404 function is a test (because it begins with test_ ), that covers the users_patch function's behavior around 404 responses. Tests can be grouped in classes starting with Test , methods that start with test_ will be picked up as tests, for example TestFeature::test_scenario . There are occasions where tests may not line up exactly with a single source file, function, or otherwise may need to deviate from this exact structure, but this is the setup in general. conftest files conftest.py files are automatically loaded by pytest, making their contents available to tests without needing to be imported. They are an easy place to put shared test fixtures as well as define other pytest configuration (define hooks, load plugins, define new/override assert behavior, etc.). They should never be imported directly. The main tests/conftest.py holds widely useful fixtures included for all tests. Scoped conftest.py files can be created that apply only to the tests below them in the directory hierarchy, for example, the tests/db/conftest.py file is only loaded for tests under tests/db/ . More info: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixture-functions Helpers If there is useful functionality that needs to be shared between tests, but is only applicable to testing and is not a fixture, create modules under tests/helpers/ . They can be imported into tests from the path tests.helpers , for example, from tests.helpers.foo import helper_func . Using Factories To facilitate easier setup of test data, most database models have factories via factory_boy in massgov/pfml/db/models/factories.py . There are a few different ways of using the factories , termed \"strategies\": build, create, and stub. Most notably for this project: The build strategy via FooFactory.build() populates a model class with the generated data, but does not attempt to write it to the database The create strategy via FooFactory.create() writes a generated model to the database (can think of it like FooFactory.build() then db_session.add() and db_session.commit() ) The build strategy is useful if the code under test just needs the data on the model and doesn't actually perform any database interactions. In order to use the create strategy, pull in the initialize_factories_session fixture. Regardless of the strategy, can override the values for attributes on the generated models by passing them into the factory call, for example: FooFactory . build ( foo_id = 5 , name = \"Bar\" ) would set foo_id=5 and name=\"Bar\" on the generated model, while all other attributes would use what's configured on the factory class. For creating a collection of generated models, there are batch methods, build_batch() and create_batch() , which will create multiple instances. For example: FooFactory . build_batch ( size = 5 ) will return 5 Foo instances with different data. Attributes set in the batch call will be shared among all the instances, so: FooFactory . build_batch ( size = 2 , parent_widget = widget ) would create 2 Foo instances with widget set as their parent_widget . Integration test marker An integration marker is configured in pytest for the project. Any test that requires a real database connection or any concrete \"resource\" outside of the code itself should be tagged with the integration marker. It indicates an \"integration\" test, as opposed to a \"unit\" test, in a somewhat loose sense. A few common situations are easy cases, if a test is covering API behavior via fixtures like app or client or testing state in the database with test_db_session , the test should be marked with integration . Accessing real files is a bit of a gray area. If testing code that needs file-like objects, should generally prefer using in-memory constructs like StringIO or BytesIO to avoid ever touching the filesystem. But currently if a test needs to load test fixture files or use tmp_path to work with a real file for some purpose, those do not need to be tagged integration . Decorate any individual test with @pytest.mark.integration .

Add environment variables Create a new config file for the environment in portal/config , copying the properties from another environment. Update the variables for the environment. Primarily, you'll want to update the environment name and the Cognito IDs, which should have been output after you ran terraform apply e.g.: module.massgov_pfml.aws_cognito_user_pool.claimants_pool: Creation complete after 2s [id=us-east-1_Bi6tPV5hz] ... module.massgov_pfml.aws_cognito_user_pool_client.massgov_pfml_client: Creation complete after 0s [id=606qc6fmb1sn3pcujrav20h66l] Set up a New Relic Browser app. Go to New Relic > Add More Data > New Relic Browser.

TODO comments Our linter enforces that TODO comments include a reference to a Jira ticket that tracks the work to implement the TODO. The expected format of a TODO is: TODO (CP-123): Message ...where CP-123 is the Jira ticket number. Why? We want to avoid losing track of work that we haven't completed, and unintentionally ship an application that doesn't work end-to-end. Making sure that we have tickets in our backlog is one major way we can avoid losing track of this work. In addition, having ticket references within TODO comments provides an engineer a way to learn additional context, and potentially learn that the work has already been completed, but the TODO got left behind in the code by accident. Creating a page All files in the portal/src/pages directory are automatically available as routes based on their name, e.g. about.js is routed to /about . Files named index.js are routed to the root of the directory. See more at the Next.js docs on routing and pages . For Employer-specific pages, files will be nested in an /employers subdirectory. Each time you add a new page, add a new route to src/routes.js . Add content strings for the page to src/locales/app/en-US.js . Add a test file for the page (and for any new components) to tests Question Pages We use a state machine to control routing between question pages in a flow. The library we use behind the scenes for this is XState . Add a new state node for the route to src/flows/claimaint.js , and add a CONTINUE transition. Read more on XState configs here . Within a meta object on the state node, add a step and fields properties. The fields value should contain the field paths for every field that may be displayed on the question page. This is important because this array is what's used for determining what validation errors should display on the question page, and also is used for identifying when a step on the checklist is In Progress or Completed. If the page should display validation issues for specific rules, add an array of applicableRules to the state's meta object. If routing to or from the page is conditional, you'll need to define guards that determine the state. Read more on xstate guards here .

The BaseAPI module is then responsible for processing the response. Below is a visual representing the flow of a request and how an API error response flows back through the app and is rendered to the user: BaseAPI The normal API error response includes an errors property in its body representing the request's issues. When errors are present, the BaseAPI throws a ValidationError that holds all API errors that were in the response body. The BaseAPI may also throw other error types, such as NotFoundError or ForbiddenError , depending on the response's status code. Logic hook The logic hooks, like useBenefitsApplicationsLogic , are responsible for catching any errors thrown by the API module and sending the error into appErrorsLogic . A typical pattern for this looks like: async updateClaim ( patchData ) { try { // Send the API request await myApi . update ( patchData ) } catch ( error ) { // Handle any API errors appErrorsLogic . catchError ( error ) } } App Errors Logic hook The useAppErrorsLogic hook is where errors get sent to for processing and storing. When appErrorsLogic.catchError receives a ValidationError holding the API response's errors, it parses each API error and creates an AppErrorInfo instance with a message generated from the API issue's type , rule , and field properties. See the getMessageFromApiIssue method for how i18n keys are generated. If you're unsure what i18n key will be generated for the issue, you can trigger the error in local development and view the console to see what key it says is missing: If a matching i18n key isn't found for the API issue, the app falls back to the original error message sent from the API. We should always have an internationalized error message, and this fallback behavior should not be relied upon. <ErrorsSummary> The ErrorsSummary component is rendered by our app container ( _app.js ) above the page component. When the appErrorsLogic module has errors present, the ErrorsSummary component renders each error's message . Inline errors Each page has access to appErrorsLogic via the appLogic prop. The errors can be read from appLogic.appErrors . If the errors are associated with a specific field on the page, you can render them inline by setting the field component's errorMsg prop. The easiest way to do this is by using the useFunctionalInputProps to set the common props for your fields, one of which is errorMsg .

The locale selection for both i18n systems is configured in i18n.js to allow locale synchronization across the app. Application This app uses i18next and its React library for application localization. You can find i18next translation resources in portal/locales/app/ . Each language has a file with a set of keys and values for every content string we need to localize for our site. The keys are how we will refer to these strings throughout our codebase, rather than hard coding the content strings. i18next patterns Our application takes advantage of some advanced patterns supported by the i18next library. It can be useful to be aware of these while working in the codebase: Context allows us to have variations of a string based on the value of a context property: t ( \"haveIncome\" , { context : \"married\" }); // -> \"Do you or your spouse have income sources?\" { \"haveIncome\" : \"Do you have income sources?\" , \"haveIncome_married\" : \"Do you or your spouse have income sources?\" } The Trans component allows us to integrate html tags such as links ( <a> tags) and text formatting tags (e.g. <strong> or <em> ) into translated text: <Trans i18nKey=\"userAgreement\" components={{ \"consent-link\": <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/paidleave-informedconsent\" />, \"privacy-policy-link\": <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/privacypolicy\" />, }} /> { \"userAgreement\" : \"To find out more about how the Commonwealth might use the information you share with DFML, please read the <consent-link>DFML Informed Consent Agreement</consent-link> and the <privacy-policy-link>Privacy Policy for Mass.gov</privacy-policy-link>.\" , } Note that we are using the alternative usage of Trans introduced in v11.6.0 where components are passed in as props rather than as children of Trans . This method allows the use of named tags in locale strings rather than needing to refer to child components by their index. Formatters are functions that define locale-specific formats for specially-formatted values such as currencies or time durations. t ( \"timeDuration\" , { minutes : 480 }); // -> \"8h\" t ( \"timeDuration\" , { minutes : 475 }); // -> \"7h 55m\" function formatValue ( value , format , locale ) { if ( format === \"hoursMinutesDuration\" ) { // Could also internationalize by using the locale value const { hours , minutes } = convertMinutesToHours ( value ); if ( minutes === 0 ) return ` ${ hours } h` ; return ` ${ hours } h ${ minutes } m` ; } return value ; { t imeDura t io n : \"{{minutes, hoursMinutesDuration}}\" , } Conventions Internationalization content can get messy and lead to hard-to-find bugs during translation. As such we strictly follow the below conventions to preserve readability, maintainability, and avoid errors. Organization Keys are organized under top-level objects by how they're used: components defines content used in specific components pages defines content used in specific pages errors defines content used in error messages, which aren\u2019t page or component specific shared defines content shared between multiple components or pages chars defines special characters (such as non-breaking spaces, which are difficult to distinguish in values) Keys are limited to three levels deep, for example pages.claimsDateOfBirth.title . This makes the structure easier to navigate and the process of finding a specific element more consistent. Naming Prioritize readability, and then brevity. Try to be consistent with existing keys. For example the title content for each page should be under a key, pages.<page-identifier>.title . When a page is related to a larger series of pages you can indicate that with a prefix. For example, the name form page within the claims flow is identified as pages.claimsName . Avoid repeating context in the key. For example, prefer pages.claimsName.sectionHint over pages.claimsName.nameSectionHint . Try to name keys after the purpose of the key, not just an underscored version of your translation. This may result in duplication of translations (i.e. multiple keys for \"First name\"), but this is much more flexible for cases down the line when one of those translations needs to change (i.e \"First name\" changes to \"Spouse's first name\"). Keys should be alphabetical so they're easier for others to find and update. We also considered sorting them by page-order where they occur but alphabetical is more easily enforced (with linting) and doesn\u2019t require re-ordering even if content on a page is re-ordered. Keys must be unique - there can't be two keys with the same name. This only applies to the entire key, for example having pages.claimsName.sectionHint and pages.claimsSsn.sectionHint is fine. Common page element terminology The PFML pages follow a design system that uses common terms for various page elements. It's helpful to use these terms when defining content strings for both the developer experience (when implementing a page design this gives you tips on how to name content strings) and in tracing content from the page back to the i18n key. These terms may change over time so this will need to be updated when they do. Some common element terms include: title - one per page sectionLabel - one per section or fieldset. This is typically either an HTML legend or label, depending on the page/section lead - additional context about an entire page, section, or fieldset legend - context about an embedded fieldset (note that sectionLabel content is always called sectionLabel even if we render it with an HTML legend element) label - typically one per input hint - additional context about a specific input Note: we use snake_case for input field names to match the names used by the API, but we don\u2019t carry that over to i18n keys. For example the state_id field on the claims license page has a label called pages.claimsLicense.stateIdLabel . For visual examples of different text elements on a page see the design team\u2019s page template designs. Sharing content All shared keys are located inside the shared object; this makes it obvious that when you're changing one of them your changes will impact multiple components/pages. This is meant to prevent accidental content changes if someone is only trying to update content in one place. Sharing content should follow this pattern: The shared content is defined with a key inside the shared object. Each page or component that uses the shared content should define its own key and reference the shared key. Shared keys, such as shared.claimsPages.leaveTypeTitle , shouldn't be referenced directly in application code. Example shared: { claimsPages: // Define the shared key here -- anyone changing this will know it affects multiple pages takingLeaveTitle: \"Who is taking leave?\", }, } pages: { claimsName: { // Reference the shared content with a key where it's used. This key, `pages.claimsName.title`, // will be the key used within the page. This makes it easy to stop using the shared content // by changing this to a content string. title: \"$t(shared.claimsPages.takingLeaveTitle)\", }, } Using markup in values Sometimes content necessitates the use of specific HTML tags. However, markup should only include tag names and not tag attributes. A tag's className , href , and other attributes should be set by the page or component that renders the key (see usage example below). Using markup in content strings can be useful but it can also make them more difficult to read and edit without introducing errors. Markup should be used sparingly. Some of the reasons for using markup in content strings include answering yes to any of these questions: Does this content require specific embedded tags for formatting? (e.g. <a> , <em> , <strong> , <ul> , <ol> , or multiple <p> tags) Does this content serve one primary function for the user? Is it helpful to edit this content as one key? (e.g. two paragraphs that serve one purpose for the user, or list items with an explicit order) Would breaking this content into multiple keys make them more difficult to name semantically or add unnecessary structure? Rendering values in pages and components Using the useTranslation hook With simple values, you only need to get the t function to render values in the functional component: import React from \"react\" ; import { useTranslation } from \"react-i18next\" ; export function MyComponent () { const { t } = useTranslation (); return < p > { t ( \"translationResourceKey\" )} < /p>; } The Trans component Since the t function can't be used for values that include markup, the Trans component is used to interpolate or translate complex react elements. Set the key in the language file, excluding all tag attributes: htmlKey: \"<ul><li>List item one</li><li>List item two has <my-link>a link</my-link></li></ul>\", Anchors are given a unique tag name in the language file, and the corresponding href value is defined in routes.js : myLink : \"http://www.example.com\" , The Trans component renders the basic tags, br , strong , i , and p . However, other tags must be explicitly defined. The components object is where attributes such as className , href can be set: import React from \"react\" ; import { Trans } from \"react-i18next\" ; < Trans i18nKey = \"htmlKey\" components = {{ \"my-link\" : ( < a target = \"_blank\" rel = \"noopener\" href = { routes . external . myLink } /> ), ul : < ul className = \"usa-list\" /> , li : < li /> , }} />","title":"Internationalization"},{"location":"portal/internationalization/#internationalization","text":"All Portal internationalization (i18n) is configured in the portal/src/locales/i18n.js module.

This method allows the use of named tags in locale strings rather than needing to refer to child components by their index. Formatters are functions that define locale-specific formats for specially-formatted values such as currencies or time durations. t ( \"timeDuration\" , { minutes : 480 }); // -> \"8h\" t ( \"timeDuration\" , { minutes : 475 }); // -> \"7h 55m\" function formatValue ( value , format , locale ) { if ( format === \"hoursMinutesDuration\" ) { // Could also internationalize by using the locale value const { hours , minutes } = convertMinutesToHours ( value ); if ( minutes === 0 ) return ` ${ hours } h` ; return ` ${ hours } h ${ minutes } m` ; } return value ; { t imeDura t io n : \"{{minutes, hoursMinutesDuration}}\" , }","title":"i18next patterns"},{"location":"portal/internationalization/#conventions","text":"Internationalization content can get messy and lead to hard-to-find bugs during translation.

Overview The primary design pattern used in the Portal is Model-View-Controller , which is the design pattern most commonly used whenever designing any application with a user interface. Data Models Not to be confused with the \"Model\" in Model-View-Controller (MVC), data models represent concepts in the context of the PFML program and the Portal. Data models are used throughout business logic and controller logic, but are not used by lower level View components which should be domain agnostic. Data models should only represent data and not have any business logic or behavior or have any dependencies outside of data models (with the possible exception of simple helper functions). App The App is the \"Controller\" for the application and is the effective entry point to the application as directed by the Nextjs framework. The App controls web application logic, what state to pass to pages, and how to handle application events like submitting claims. Top level application logic should live here. Pages Page components are the primary \"Controller\" unit of the application and represent a single page of the user experience. Page components are the lowest level \"Controller\" in our application (with the exception of more complex View components that have their own nested MVC pattern). Page components control which \"View\" components to render, what state to pass to the components to render, and what event handlers to use to handle \"View\" events. Components Components are the primary \"View\" unit of the application. Simple components simply render data that is passed to them, and exposes events that parent components (the view's controller) can listen to. More complex components can themselves act as controllers and have their own models and nested controllers/views. The QuestionPage component is an example of a more complex component that includes a back button and a \"Save and Continue\" button with onSave and onContinue events that can be listened to. API The API module is reponsible for application-level business logic. This represents the top level \"Model\" in the MVC design pattern. This includes starting claims, submitting claims, identity proofing, setting payment preferences, etc. State Hooks State hooks are modules used by various components to define and update the state of the application. These hooks represent the \"Model\" in the MVC design pattern and should not have any knowledge of controller or view code. An example of a state hook is useFormState . Event Hooks Event hooks are modules that define functions to handle view events. These modules attach view events to the appropriate model update functions, and are the glue that allows us to keep \"Model\" and \"View\" decoupled from each other. Examples of event hooks include useHandleInputChange and useAppLogic . Dependencies To help prevent technical debt, when adding new modules, consider adding assertions to dependencies.test.js to restrict where the module is used, or what dependencies the new module is allowed to have. Services Services expose functionality that offers a coherent feature / addresses a business need (e.g. services/featureFlags.js ). A rule of thumb to use is that services are things that could conceptually be turned into separate microservices. In practice, some of these will actually be served by external services and others will not. Examples include caching, translation/localization, validation, authentication, and any APIs. For example, in our codebase we already have these services: Error monitoring: uses external New Relic API, so this is an \"actual\" service Feature flags: these don't use an external APIs in this implementation but instead just uses the browser APIs (cookies) to accomplish the task. We could conceivably refactor this module to rely on an external API though.

It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to run the Portal application, or navigating around the Portal flow. You can read more below about the process and collaboration goals behind our usage of Storybook. The ultimate output is a static site that currently gets deployed here . (Related: Deploy docs ) Contributing to Storybook First: The Storybook docs are great. If your question isn't answered in this doc, it's likely answered in their docs. This doc is more of a TLDR to get you started contributing to our Storybook. Developers can run Storybook locally by running: npm run docs Adding a new story Each page in Storybook is generated from *.stories.js files located in portal/storybook/stories/ . This file exports functions ( \"stories\" ), each of which is rendered on the page. The functions can render any arbitrary React, so a Story can render a page, component, or plain HTML. For example, here's a Storybook page with a single story that renders a preview of our Button component: // portal/storybook/stories/components/Button.stories.js import Button from \"src/components/Button\"; import React from \"react\"; export default { // this determines where the story shows in the site's sidebar menu: title: \"Components/Button\", // this is used to generate the props table on the page: component: Button, // these are passed into each story and enable nifty // live editing in the site's UI: args: { children: \"Save and continue\", handleClick: () => alert(\"Clicked!\"), }, }; export const Primary = (args) => { return <Button {...args} />; }; Learn more about writing stories \u2192 Previewing entire pages In Next.js, a page is just a React component . This enables some pretty cool capabilities when combined with Storybook. Specifically, this means we can create a Story that renders a Page component, which allows us to preview an entire page without navigating through the entire application flow to preview the page. For the Create Claim flow, we're generating a Storybook page for each page in the flow . Engineers can override the generated story by adding a *.stories.js file for the page in the storybook/stories/pages/claims/ directory. How Storybook interacts with our source code Storybook stories import and render the same components used in the live site. Below is a visualization attempting to demonstrate how assets are shared between our web application and the Storybook site. For engineers For the engineering team, Storybook provides a place to document components and also provides a place outside of our Next.js app to preview new components being developed. For engineers, Storybook aims to answer questions like: What components exist? How does this component behave when rendered? What is this component for? What props does this component expect? Engineers could also look at the source code to answer most of these questions, but Storybook provides a friendly UI to answer them. It also provides a mechanism for producing smaller pull requests \u2014 for instance, rather than creating a component and connecting it to our application logic, an engineer could first create a pull request that adds just the component and a corresponding Storybook story for previewing the component. For designers There's also a world where Storybook can be used as a shared tool, supporting a more collaborative workflow between Engineering, Design, and Product teams. One goal is to have a source of truth for design pattern documentation and guidance. Ideally that lives close to the actual implementation of the patterns. The goals for Storybook in this case would be to answer the questions above, as well as questions like: Why does this design pattern exist? What problems is it addressing? What does this design pattern look like at different screen sizes? What have we learned about this pattern through user research? How has it evolved? This may mean that some Storybook pages are more in-depth than others. These more extensive documentation pages would be a collaboration between Engineering and Design. Engineering's role might be: code the components and setup the Storybook page with an example of the component. It would then be Design's role to contribute design documentation, like any decisions or research that fed into the creation of the pattern, or guidance on different ways the component should be used.

Read the Jest documentation to learn how to write assertions. A good place to start if you are new to JS testing is to learn about Using Matchers . Below is an example of a test: import sum from \"./sum\" ; describe ( \"sum\" , () => { it ( \"adds 1 + 2 to equal 3\" , () => { const result = sum ( 1 , 2 ); expect ( result ). toBe ( 3 ); }); }); Creating new test files A test file should be placed in the appropriate tests directory (e.g. portal/tests ) rather than alongside the file it tests. These test files should have the same name as the file they're testing, and have .test.js as the extension. For example, pages/index.js and tests/pages/index.test.js . Unit tests Enzyme is a test utility used alongside Jest to test React components. Read the Enzyme documentation to learn how to Render React components and how to pull information from those React components in order to run test assertions against them. For simple, stateless components (which hopefully will be most components), you can \"Shallow render\" the component. Shallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and to ensure that your tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components. It's also helps reduce test suite runtime. Below is an example of a React component test: import UploadForm from \"./UploadForm\" ; import { shallow } from \"enzyme\" ; describe ( \"<UploadForm>\" , () => { describe ( \"when the form is submitted\" , () => { it ( \"calls onSubmit\" , () => { const mockSubmit = jest . fn (); const wrapper = shallow ( < UploadForm onSubmit = { mockSubmit } /> ); wrapper . simulate ( \"submit\" ); expect ( mockSubmit ). toHaveBeenCalled (); }); }); }); Snapshot tests Snapshot tests are useful for testing when a React component or JSON output changes unexpectedly. A typical snapshot test case is to render a UI component, take a snapshot, then compares it to the last snapshot that was taken. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match. If a snapshot test fails, you should identify whether it failed because the change was unexpected. If it was an unexpected change, then you may have unintentionally broke an expected behavior, in which case you should investigate and fix it before sending the PR out for review. If it failed because you intentionally changed something related to the test, then the snapshot should be updated to reflect the intended change. To update snapshots, run: npm run test:update-snapshots Learn more about Snapshot Testing. JSON snapshot example it ( \"renders the fields with the expected content and attributes\" , () => { const output = callMethodAndReturnJSON (); // You can use inline snapshots if the output is fairly short: expect ( output ). toMatchInlineSnapshot (); }); React snapshot example it ( \"renders the fields with the expected content and attributes\" , () => { const wrapper = shallow ( < UploadFields /> ); // You can output the snapshot to a separate file if its output is verbose: expect ( wrapper ). toMatchSnapshot (); }); Mocks Mock functions make it easy to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.
