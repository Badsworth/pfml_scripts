These guidelines are meant to reinforce those two goals. For reviewers Aim to respond to code reviews within 1 business day. Remember to highlight things that you like and appreciate while reading through the changes, and to make any other feedback clearly actionable by indicating if it is optional preference, an important consideration, or an error. Don't be afraid to comment with a question, or to ask for clarification, or provide a suggestion, whenever you don\u2019t understand what is going on at first glance \u2014 or if you think an approach or decision can be improved. Code reviews give us a chance to learn from one another, and to reflect, iterate on, and document why certain decisions are made. Once you're ready to approve or request changes, err on the side of trust. Send a vote of approval if the PR looks ready except for small minor changes, and trust that the recipient will address your comments before merging by replying via comment or code to any asks. Use \"request changes\" sparingly, unless there's a blocking issue or major refactors that should be done. For authors or requesters PR titles Include the JIRA ticket number in the title. For example: PFML-123: Implement API endpoint . A single JIRA ticket may be associated with multiple pull requests. Every change should have an associated JIRA ticket unless it is a documentation change. This makes it easier to search for PRs and generates a link in the Jira ticket to the pull request, which provides the program with an audit trail for verifying the relevant code changes, approvals, and test cases. For tickets that have subtasks, use the parent ticket's id in the title, and include the subtask in the PR description. If it is a documentation change, please prefix with docs: docs: Clean up CONTRIBUTING.md . Draft PRs If your PR is a work-in-progress, or if you are looking for specific feedback on things, create a Draft Pull Request and state what you are looking for in the description. Your PR should be small enough that a reviewer can reasonably respond within 1-2 business days. For larger changes, break them down into a series of PRs. If refactors are included in your changes, try to split them out as recommended below. As a PR writer, you should consider your description and comments as documentation; current and future team members will refer to it to understand your design decisions. Include relevant context and business requirements, and add preemptive comments (in code or PR) for sections of code that may be confusing or worth debate. Requesting reviews from your feature team Assign the PR to be reviewed by people within your feature team if your changes are within the existing software architecture, uses existing patterns and tools, and you are confident that your changes follows the latest best practices. In this situation, your feature team is most likely to have the most context on the business requirements and whether your changes meets those requirements. Note that code review culture within each feature team may differ - Some teams are configured so that PR review requests are automatically assigned to a member of the team via a round robin algorithm, with the goal of equally distributing PR reviews across the team. Requesting reviews from subject matter experts If you are making changes that have complexity and may benefit from a pair of eyes with more familiarity with the particular area you are changing, assign the PR to be reviewed by the relevant GitHub team. Complexity can include: - Changes in complex and/or critical systems (payments, auth, integrations) - Changes that have non-functional success criteria that are hard to directly test (accessibility, architecture and security) - Changes that can potentially impact other features or other teams (infrastructure changes, changes to database schema / data model, tooling) - Changes in areas of the codebase that have inconsistent practices or are in the midst of a refactor involving introducing new best practices and deprecating legacy practices - Changes to core areas of the code that aren't changed very often (architecture, tooling) Reference the following list of teams when considering who you might want to review your PR.

Below are guidelines (not strict rules) for working once you're ready. Use your best judgement or consult your fellow engineers to follow the spirit of the guidelines and know when it makes sense to deviate on a case by case basis. We follow trunk-based development , which means: Make small changes in short-lived feature branches and merge to main frequently. Maintain a high test coverage in an automated test suite that runs on every pull request before merging. Utilize feature flags to control the release of larger features. Keep each component (Portal, Admin Portal, API, Busines Intelligence Platform, and Infrastructure) in a releasable state on its own. Keep system components separately releasable Treat the Claimant/Leave Admin Portal, the Admin Portal, the API, the Business Intelligence Platform, and Infrastructure for each, as separate system components that are deployed separately. Components should always be releasable, in any order or at the same time. Avoid hard dependencies on changes to other components that are not already in production. Treat each change you merge to main as immediately deployable to production. Do not merge changes that depend on subsequent changes you plan to make, even if you plan to make those changes shortly. Use feature flags or other techniques to make changes deployable (see section below on feature flags). Avoid changing more than one component in a single pull request, unless it's simpler and low risk to do so. In general, changes that depend on changes in other components should be planned ahead accordingly. Short-lived feature branches Prefix the branch name with your name e.g. lorenyu/pfml-123-new-feature . Be open to submitting multiple small pull requests for a single ticket (i.e. reference the same ticket across multiple PRs). Make sure each cumulative change is deployable on its own. Separate changes that include a lot of autogenerated diffs (e.g. new package dependencies or upgrades that create large diffs in poetry.lock and package-json.lock should be in their own PRs) Consider separating API design changes from implementation changes (e.g. adding new API endpoints to openapi.yaml can be in its own PR with stub implementations) Testing Add automated test coverage for new code\u200b. Keep tests passing. Update or remove tests if appropriate. Keep your branch updated with main regularly (at least daily): Rebase your changes onto main with git rebase main , or Merge main onto your own branch: git merge main . The favored pathway to keep your branch updated is to use git merge main. It's still possible to rebase and force-push your branch using git rebase main , but this pathway should be avoided if your branch is being worked on by more than one person at a time, due to the risk of causing unnecessary conflicts. Feature flags Utilize feature flags to have new logic live concurrently with old logic before the feature is complete end-to-end. See Feature Flags Code Reviews Get your code reviewed by your scrum team and in some cases additional component teams. See code reviews Code reviewers are expected to review code quickly (within 1 business day) Merging Only merge when all automated checks have returned green and when the PR has received at least one approval. Although GitHub does not block the merge of a PR that fails its checks, any failed checks should be treated as a blocking issue and resolved before the PR is merged. Verify that the commit title starts with the JIRA ticket. Write clear, concise merge commit message titles. See How to Write a Git Commit Message Clean up the merge commit message body to include a concise summary of the changes. Use the PR description as a starting point. Do not use the default commit message from GitHub. If the PR only has a single commit, GitHub will default to using that commit subject and description. This is often incorrect, missing the JIRA ticket. If the PR has multiple commits, GitHub will default to using the commit messages from each of the PR's commits. This is also often incorrect, as it is represents a history of the PR's changes rather than a concise summary of the changes. Do: PFML-540: Implement GET claims endpoint (#145) https://lwd.atlassian.net/browse/PFML-540 Implements /claims endpoint which is a GET that takes a valid user ID and returns their first claim from the database. Demo: Unit tests and adhoc testing via swagger UI. Don't: add claims endpoint (#145) * formatting * fix * change endpoint * initial endpoint Note on Database Changes A particular source of danger when merging a PR is the risk that the merge will introduce conflicts to the PFML API's database schema. This scenario is not uncommon, especially for branches that introduce new database migrations and that have not yet been updated with the latest changes to main. The API's test suite cannot detect these conflicts, so they have historically been discovered only after PR merge, when deployment of the API begins to fail. To mitigate this risk, any engineer who introduces new database migrations to the API should pay special attention to the \"Pre-Merge Conflict Check\", an automated check that should appear on any pull request that makes changes to api/massgov/pfml/db/migrations/versions . This special 'pseudo-check' will diff your branch against main, and fail if it detects that your branch is missing any database migrations that are already present on main. To mitigate the risk that updates to main will, occasionally, introduce new database conflicts to unmerged branches, this pseudo-check will automatically re-run itself whenever a new database migration is pushed to main, and additionally whenever new commits are pushed to your PR's feature branch. For these reasons, please make sure you check the status of any database conflicts before merging an approved PR. To avoid these conflicts, any PR that alters the database must be updated with the latest changes to main before being merged.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#delivery-workflow","text":"Please see the Delivery Workflow Confluence page for guidance on how to pick up tickets, when to deploy, which environment to deploy to, etc.","title":"Delivery Workflow"},{"location":"contributing/#local-development-guidelines","text":"For practical instructions on getting set up locally, see the repo README .

Initial Setup Update the infra/constants/outputs.tf file, specifically: environment_tags environment_shorthand smartronix_environment_tags Domains, api_domains, or cert_domains do not need to be updated unless there are new domains. Please check with Chris Griffith or tech lead to confirm. For smartronix_environment_tags, reach out to Ron Lovell, Karen Grant, Andy Rodriguez, and Chris Griffith and ask what the new tag should be based on the environment name. They will kick off the Smartronix CAMS infra-monitoring harness for the new environment as well as start any manual DBA steps for the database. If you need a new EOTSS-approved tag for environment_tags, send an email to Tim.L.Sharpe@mass.gov requesting a new tag. The S3 bucket for holding tfstate files must be created first in infra/pfml-aws/s3.tf . Run terraform apply . This may require admin permissions. As well as the replica bucket in LWD account.

Setting up the Portal Environment Generate the terraform environment folder: pfml$ bin/bootstrap-env/bootstrap-env.sh NEW_ENV portal The command above creates a new directory: infra/portal/environments/NEW_ENV 2. From the new directory, run: terraform init Create the environment, providing a specific cloudfront_origin_path since nothing will be deployed yet. You can use a blank path for now: terraform plan -var = 'cloudfront_origin_path=' terraform apply -var = 'cloudfront_origin_path=' *** you might run into some permission issue on creating IAM roles. In this case, please reach out to an engineer with admin permission. Sync the cognito secrets to parameter store: bin/bootstrap-env/sync-cognito-variables.sh $NEW_ENV Update infra/api/environments/NEW_ENV/main.tf and infra/ecs-tasks/environments/NEW_ENV/main.tf to include the cognito variables as output from the previous script. cognito_user_pool_arn = \"arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:498823821309:userpool/$pool_id\" cognito_user_pool_id = \"$pool_id\" cognito_user_pool_client_id = \"$api_client_id\" cognito_user_pool_keys_url = \"https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/$pool_id/.well-known/jwks.json\" Follow additional steps for new Portal environments . Configuring Cognito This is only required for environments that will not run E2E tests. For most environments this is not required. In production, we block high-risk login attempts. This can also be configured for other environments if desired. High-risk login attempts aren't blocked in environments used for testing so that automated test scripts don't get blocked. Our Terraform scripts enable Advanced Security. however at the time of writing, Terraform didn't support more granular configuration of the Advanced Security settings , so there are some manual steps needed: Log into the AWS Console and navigate to the Cognito User Pool for this environment. Click \"Advanced Security\" in the sidebar Configure the adaptive authentication behavior . On the same page in AWS customize the email notification messages by copy-and-pasting the HTML email templates from infra/portal/templates/emails . Ensure the email FROM address is \"NEWENV-SHORTHAND_Department of Family and Medical Leave\" \\<PFML_DoNotReply@eol.mass.gov\\>\" . 4. Integrating with FINEOS Configure PFML credentials for FINEOS Create the FINEOS user in the PFML database. This depends on the cognito_fineos_app_client_id secret being configured in Parameter Store from step 2.2, as part of API setup. ./bin/run-ecs-task/run-task.sh NEW_ENV db-create-fineos-user FIRST_NAME.LAST_NAME Create a file locally with the Cognito FINEOS app client ID and secret. You can view this data by going to AWS Console > AWS Cognito > User Pools > [[ select the environment's user pool ]] > App Clients. Look for the fineos-pfml-{env} client. Send it to FINEOS over interchange, then delete the file from your local computer. Also send the following details: Auth URL: (e.g. https://paidleave-api-cps-preview.eol.mass.gov/api/v1/oauth2/token) Integration URLs (e.g. https://paidleave-api-cps-preview.eol.mass.gov/api/v1/rmv-check, https://paidleave-api-cps-preview.eol.mass.gov/api/v1/financial-eligibility) VPC IP Address (Should be nonprod IP: VPC-EOLWD-PFML-NonProd, vpc-097793bd468be1c65, 10.203.224.0/22) VPC ID (Should be nonprod IP: VPC-EOLWD-PFML-NonProd, vpc-097793bd468be1c65, 10.203.224.0/22) VPC S3 Endpoint ID (Should be nonprod endpoint: vpce-057c4dd758ba5ccb1) *** Some engineers in Fineos side might not have access to Interchange (https://ics.mass.gov/DynIC/) platform. You need to ask them to create account on that platform. It is a self service. Engineers can also reach out to Chris Griffith on the details. Configure FINEOS credentials for PFML FINEOS should send a file to us with an oauth client ID and secret. If not, ping Howard Teasley and Darnel. The client ID should be configured in both : infra/api/environments/NEW_ENV/main.tf and infra/ecs-tasks/environments/NEW_ENV/main.tf. The client secret value should be updated in parameter store ( /service/pfml-api/NEW_ENV/fineos_oauth2_client_secret ). Add portal_base_url = \"https://paidleave-NEW_ENV.(dfml).eol.mass.gov\" to infra/api/environments/NEW_ENV/main.tf file. Attention The configuration values provided by Fineos team for the new environments might vary. Therefore, please double check with Fineos team on the configurations values. hint You can also check the configuration values of the other environments to compare and confirm. Verify the following details with FINEOS: - Will SSO be enabled? (If so, we need to configure the FINEOS user as OASIS instead of CONTENT) - What is the FINEOS URL? - What is the FINEOS S3 path for data exports/imports? 4. Update CI and Monitoring Add the new environment to the CI build matrix so it can be validated when it's changed. Add the new environment to the monitoring module to create API and Portal alarms that are linked to PagerDuty. Add the new environment to the NewRelic Dashboard by updating EnvironmentsTable.js file in e2e folder. Add the new environment to the makefile in API by adding the release branch deploy/api/NEW_ENV Add the new environment to the makefile in Portal by adding the release branch deploy/portal/NEW_ENV Reach out to e2e team to update their test script with new environment. 5. Update feature_flags files Add NEW_ENV.yaml file to /pflm/feature_flags/ folder in rool level and corresponding content. Make sure that correspoing feature flag s3 bucket is created for the new environment. Setting up Custom Domains If we expect FINEOS to call the PFML API, you'll need a custom mass.gov domain for the environment. Please follow these steps: Request an ACM cert in the AWS Console > AWS Certificate Manager, with Email Verification. Example: Domain Name SANs paidleave-performance.eol.mass.gov paidleave-training.eol.mass.gov, paidleave-api-training.eol.mass.gov, paidleave-api-performance.eol.mass.gov This requires an individual with cloudops/administrator permissions.

Manually adjust the migration file as needed. Some changes will not fully auto-generate (like foreign keys), so make sure that all desired changes are included. Multi-head situations Alembic migrations form an ordered history, with each migration having at least one parent migration as specified by the down_revision variable. This can be visualized by: make db-migrate-history When multiple migrations are created that point to the same down_revision a branch is created, with the tip of each branch being a \"head\". The above history command will show this, but a list of just the heads can been retrieved with: make db-migrate-heads CI/CD runs migrations to reach the \"head\". When there are multiple, Alembic can't resolve which migrations need to be run. If you run into this error, you'll need to fix the migration branches/heads before merging to main . If the migrations don't depend on each other, which is likely if they've branched, then you can just run: make db-migrate-merge-heads Which will create a new migration pointing to all current \"head\"s, effectively pulling them all together. When branched migrations do need to happen in a defined order, then manually update the down_revision of one that should happen second to reference to the migration that should happen first. Deployment Our deployment is a two-step process: Run database migrations, which will update table schemas. Update API code. Since we're updating two independent services, we should consider how code changes across the API and database might cause integration issues during rollout (similar to code changes across the portal and api). Part of the reason DB migrations run before app deploys (instead of after) is so that additions don\u2019t need to be split out, i.e. migrations that add columns for new features don\u2019t need delayed treatment. A new column can be added to the DB before the app code using it is deployed so they can go out in the same commit/release. However, if we are removing a column or table from the DB, we need to split this across two deploys. Otherwise, the app is likely to break, since in between steps 1 & 2 above, the app may try to access a table or column that no longer exists in our databse. Removing a column First Deploy In order to remove a column, we'll first need to remove all usage of the column in the API code base. However, since the column will still be in the database model, SQLAlchemy will still include it in SELECT s and INSERT s for the table. We'll need to set this column to deferred , in order to exclude it from queries, and to evaluates_none , to stop inserting null for it. We have a function deprecated_column that handles both of those changes, so we can easily make this change by updating column_to_remove = Column(...) to column_to_remove = deprecated_column(...) . Second Deploy Once the column usage removal has been deployed (including deprecating the column in the database model), we can safely remove the column from the database model and the actual database. To do so, simply delete the deprecated column from the database model and create a corresponding database migration. Removing a table First Deploy Removing a table is similar to, but simpler than, removing a column. You'll still start by removing all usage of the table in the API code base. No further steps are required at this point, since SQLAlchemy won't be interacting with the table at this point. Second Deploy Once the table usage removal has been deployed, we can safely remove the table from the database model and the actual database.

It sets up Python, Poetry and installs development dependencies automatically, and can create a full environment including the API application and a backing database. Follow instructions here to install Docker for your OS. In a docker-centric environment, we support a couple different developer workflows: Start command from: Container Lifetime RUN_CMD_OPT your host \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Long-running DOCKER_EXEC inside docker \ud83d\udc33 Long-running N/A your host \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Single-use DOCKER_RUN Mixed Mixed Mixed The default is DOCKER_RUN and should always just work\u2122. But this spins up a new container for every command, which can be slow. If you are working on the API a lot, you may want to consider one of the alternative setups below and/or the Native Developer Setup . Note: Some tasks, including initial setup, will usually need to be run with DOCKER_RUN regardless of the workflow used otherwise. Examples include generating an initial local JWKS ( make jwks.json ) or running migrations ( make db-upgrade ). Send commands from your host to a long-running container If you want to re-use a docker application for various Python and development make commands (e.g. linting and testing), you should set RUN_CMD_OPT to DOCKER_EXEC . $ export RUN_CMD_OPT = DOCKER_EXEC $ make test Log into a docker container to run commands If you intend to start a Docker environment and log into it like a remote server, you can leave RUN_CMD_OPT alone and use make login instead. $ make login > make test Start a new docker container for every command If you plan to run commands through temporary, single-use Docker containers, you should set your RUN_CMD_OPT to DOCKER_RUN : $ export RUN_CMD_OPT = DOCKER_RUN $ make test Note this is the default setting. Mix and Match If you plan to mix and match things, you'll have to juggle RUN_CMD_OPT yourself. For example: - running static lints outside of Docker with native developer setup: RUN_CMD_OPT=NATIVE make lint - running tests inside of Docker after a make start : RUN_CMD_OPT=DOCKER_EXEC make test Native Developer Setup To setup a development environment outside of Docker, you'll need to install a few things.

We should be careful not to accidentally deny a claimant\u2019s right to an appeal or otherwise make the system less flexible than it needs to be as is so often the case with government systems. Adding validation rules Validation rules currently are enforced at three different layers: OpenAPI generally enforces a subset of rules on individual fields Pydantic models enforce some business rules on individual fields Custom code enforces presence of required fields or rules requiring context of multiple fields OpenAPI OpenAPI is the first layer a request flows through, and enforces a subset of validation rules: type format pattern enum For all endpoints, these validations always result in a 400 status code with errors when a rule is not fulfilled. These validations are located in the openapi.yml spec file. Why we avoid OpenAPI's required property To display a user friendly internationalized error message to Portal users, the error must include the field that is missing and a consistent type . For example: { \"errors\" : [ { \"field\" : \"password\" , \"type\" : \"required\" } ] } OpenAPI pitfalls: The main deal breaker is when using the OpenAPI's required property, the error response doesn't return the name of the specific field that is missing . It just returns the full array of fields that are required. This prevents Portal from displaying a useful error message. Some endpoints are split across multiple pages in the Portal so it will be expected that not all required fields are present at once in a request. Pydantic field validator Individual fields on a Pydantic model can have custom validation logic to enforce business rules or reality checks (e.g a birthdate must be in the past).

If you are new to pytest, reading up on how fixtures work in particular might be helpful as it's one area that is a bit different than is common with other runners (and languages). Naming pytest automatically discovers tests by following a number of conventions (what it calls \"collection\"). For this project specifically: All tests live under tests/ Under tests/ , the organization mirrors the source code structure, but without the massgov/pfml/ part, so for example: The tests for massgov/pfml/api/ live under tests/api/ massgov/pfml/util/aws/ under test/util/aws/ . Create __init__.py files for each directory. This helps avoid name conflicts when pytest is resolving tests . Test files should begin with the test_ prefix, followed by the module the tests cover, for example, a file foo.py will have tests in a file test_foo.py . Tests for massgov/pfml/api/applications.py live at tests/api/test_applications.py Test cases should begin with the test_ prefix, followed by the function it's testing and some description of what about the function it is testing. In tests/api/test_users.py , the test_users_patch_404 function is a test (because it begins with test_ ), that covers the users_patch function's behavior around 404 responses. Tests can be grouped in classes starting with Test , methods that start with test_ will be picked up as tests, for example TestFeature::test_scenario . There are occasions where tests may not line up exactly with a single source file, function, or otherwise may need to deviate from this exact structure, but this is the setup in general. conftest files conftest.py files are automatically loaded by pytest, making their contents available to tests without needing to be imported. They are an easy place to put shared test fixtures as well as define other pytest configuration (define hooks, load plugins, define new/override assert behavior, etc.). They should never be imported directly. The main tests/conftest.py holds widely useful fixtures included for all tests. Scoped conftest.py files can be created that apply only to the tests below them in the directory hierarchy, for example, the tests/db/conftest.py file is only loaded for tests under tests/db/ . More info: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html?highlight=conftest#scope-sharing-fixtures-across-classes-modules-packages-or-session Helpers If there is useful functionality that needs to be shared between tests, but is only applicable to testing and is not a fixture, create modules under tests/helpers/ . They can be imported into tests from the path tests.helpers , for example, from tests.helpers.foo import helper_func . Using Factories To facilitate easier setup of test data, most database models have factories via factory_boy in massgov/pfml/db/models/factories.py . There are a few different ways of using the factories , termed \"strategies\": build, create, and stub. Most notably for this project: The build strategy via FooFactory.build() populates a model class with the generated data, but does not attempt to write it to the database The create strategy via FooFactory.create() writes a generated model to the database (can think of it like FooFactory.build() then db_session.add() and db_session.commit() ) The build strategy is useful if the code under test just needs the data on the model and doesn't actually perform any database interactions. In order to use the create strategy, pull in the initialize_factories_session fixture. Regardless of the strategy, can override the values for attributes on the generated models by passing them into the factory call, for example: FooFactory . build ( foo_id = 5 , name = \"Bar\" ) would set foo_id=5 and name=\"Bar\" on the generated model, while all other attributes would use what's configured on the factory class. For creating a collection of generated models, there are batch methods, build_batch() and create_batch() , which will create multiple instances. For example: FooFactory . build_batch ( size = 5 ) will return 5 Foo instances with different data. Attributes set in the batch call will be shared among all the instances, so: FooFactory . build_batch ( size = 2 , parent_widget = widget ) would create 2 Foo instances with widget set as their parent_widget . Integration test marker An integration marker is configured in pytest for the project. Any test that requires a real database connection or any concrete \"resource\" outside of the code itself should be tagged with the integration marker. It indicates an \"integration\" test, as opposed to a \"unit\" test, in a somewhat loose sense. A few common situations are easy cases, if a test is covering API behavior via fixtures like app or client or testing state in the database with test_db_session , the test should be marked with integration . Accessing real files is a bit of a gray area. If testing code that needs file-like objects, should generally prefer using in-memory constructs like StringIO or BytesIO to avoid ever touching the filesystem. But currently if a test needs to load test fixture files or use tmp_path to work with a real file for some purpose, those do not need to be tagged integration . In the vast majority of cases, the appropriate tests will get automatically tagged with the integration marker behind the scenes via the fixtures it uses. Automatic marking Test fixtures that use real resources should request the fixture has_external_dependencies . @pytest . fixture def some_fixture_using_real_resources ( has_external_dependencies ): ... Fixtures that have the has_external_dependencies fixture in their dependency graph do not need to explicitly request the has_external_dependencies fixture.

Manual marking To manually mark integration tests, decorate any individual test with @pytest.mark.integration .

Scheduling and Triggers If you need to run the ECS task on a schedule or trigger it based off of an AWS S3 event, you can do so using the existing patterns in cloudwatch.tf and s3_subscriptions.tf . Testing Testing the Entrypoint The entrypoint is runnable locally using poetry, outside of the context of an ECS task, and is the fastest way to test functionality live without a deployment.

We want to avoid losing track of work that we haven't completed, and unintentionally ship an application that doesn't work end-to-end.

In addition, having ticket references within TODO comments provides an engineer a way to learn additional context, and potentially learn that the work has already been completed, but the TODO got left behind in the code by accident. Creating a page All files in the portal/src/pages directory are automatically available as routes based on their name, e.g. about.js is routed to /about . Files named index.js are routed to the root of the directory. See more at the Next.js docs on routing and pages . For Employer-specific pages, files will be nested in an /employers subdirectory. Each time you add a new page, add a new route to src/routes.js . Add content strings for the page to src/locales/app/en-US.js . Add a test file for the page (and for any new components) to tests Question Pages We use a state machine to control routing between question pages in a flow. The library we use behind the scenes for this is XState . Add a new state node for the route to src/flows/claimaint.js , and add a CONTINUE transition. Read more on XState configs here . Within a meta object on the state node, add a step and fields properties. The fields value should contain the field paths for every field that may be displayed on the question page. This is important because this array is what's used for determining what validation errors should display on the question page, and also is used for identifying when a step on the checklist is In Progress or Completed. If the page should display validation issues for specific rules, add an array of applicableRules to the state's meta object. If routing to or from the page is conditional, you'll need to define guards that determine the state. Read more on xstate guards here .

See errors.ts . BaseAPI Unsuccessful API requests, due to system or validation errors, will receive an errors array in the response body. When errors are present, the BaseAPI module throws a ValidationError . This ValidationError includes an issues field which stores the API response's errors . If no errors were present on the API error response body, the BaseAPI module will throw an error based on the response status code, such as NotFoundError , ForbiddenError , etc. API hooks API hooks, like useClaimsLogic , are responsible for catching any errors thrown by the API request. A typical pattern for this looks like: async updateClaim ( patchData ) { try { // Send the API request await myApi . update ( patchData ) } catch ( error ) { // Handle any API errors errorsLogic . catchError ( error ) } } Errors hook The useErrorsLogic hook is the source of truth for errors state management. To handle an error and display its message in the UI, call the error logic hook's catchError method. Custom handlers can be added for specific error subclasses, if necessary. Error messages & internationalization (i18n) All error messages should be internationalized. This means every error message should have a key/value mapping in the errors object of our internationalization file(s), and we shouldn't rely on the default error message defined on the API's error response. I18n keys The i18n keys for error messages are automatically generated, based on: Which API endpoint the error is thrown from The error instance type (e.g. ValidationError , NotFoundError , etc.) And if the error has an issues field, then the issue's type , field and rule properties. The logic for the last point above is somewhat difficult to describe in plain language, so it may be easier to reference the code itself: check out getI18nKeysForIssue in the IssueErrorMessage component . If you're unsure what i18n keys will be generated for an issue, you can trigger the error in local development and view the console to see what keys it makes available: If an i18n key isn't found for the API issue, the app falls back to the original error message sent from the API. But again, we should always have an internationalized error message, and this fallback behavior should not be relied upon. Links and HTML in error messages Error messages support a subset of HTML elements and links. To safelist a new HTML element or link, update the object in useErrorI18nComponents . UI Components Various UI components are responsible for internationalizing and displaying errors to the user. Below is a quick summary.

Its heading is dynamic, based on the number of errors. <IssueErrorMessage> - Given an entry in an error's issues array, this component renders a single internationalized message. Inline errors Each page has access to errorsLogic via the default appLogic prop. If an error includes an issues entry that is associated with a specific field on the page, you can render the issue's message inline by setting the field component's errorMsg prop.

To do so, add a query param of _ff to the site's URL and use JSON notation for its value. A feature flag's value can be true , false , or reset . Setting a flag to reset will restore it to the environment's default. For example: To enable a feature flag called unrestrictedClaimFlow , you would visit: {Site URL}?_ff=unrestrictedClaimFlow:true To disable a feature flag called unrestrictedClaimFlow , you would visit: {Site URL}?_ff=unrestrictedClaimFlow:false To reset a feature flag called unrestrictedClaimFlow , you would visit: {Site URL}?_ff=unrestrictedClaimFlow:reset You can also manage multiple flags by separating their key/value pairs with a ; . For example: {Site URL}?_ff=unrestrictedClaimFlow:true;anotherFlag:true Preventing / Allowing the site to be rendered While the site is under development, we don't want it to be visible to the press or the public .

The locale selection for both i18n systems is configured in i18n.js to allow locale synchronization across the app. Application This app uses i18next and its React library for application localization. You can find i18next translation resources in portal/locales/app/ . Each language has a file with a set of keys and values for every content string we need to localize for our site. The keys are how we will refer to these strings throughout our codebase, rather than hard coding the content strings. i18next patterns Our application takes advantage of some advanced patterns supported by the i18next library. It can be useful to be aware of these while working in the codebase: Context allows us to have variations of a string based on the value of a context property: t ( \"haveIncome\" , { context : \"married\" }); // -> \"Do you or your spouse have income sources?\" { \"haveIncome\" : \"Do you have income sources?\" , \"haveIncome_married\" : \"Do you or your spouse have income sources?\" } The Trans component allows us to integrate html tags such as links ( <a> tags) and text formatting tags (e.g. <strong> or <em> ) into translated text: <Trans i18nKey=\"userAgreement\" components={{ \"consent-link\": ( <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/paidleave-informedconsent\" /> ), \"privacy-policy-link\": <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/privacypolicy\" />, }} /> { \"userAgreement\" : \"To find out more about how the Commonwealth might use the information you share with DFML, please read the <consent-link>DFML Informed Consent Agreement</consent-link> and the <privacy-policy-link>Privacy Policy for Mass.gov</privacy-policy-link>.\" } Note that we are using the alternative usage of Trans introduced in v11.6.0 where components are passed in as props rather than as children of Trans . This method allows the use of named tags in locale strings rather than needing to refer to child components by their index. Formatters are functions that define locale-specific formats for specially-formatted values such as currencies or time durations. t ( \"timeDuration\" , { minutes : 480 }); // -> \"8h\" t ( \"timeDuration\" , { minutes : 475 }); // -> \"7h 55m\" function formatValue ( value , format , locale ) { if ( format === \"hoursMinutesDuration\" ) { // Could also internationalize by using the locale value const { hours , minutes } = convertMinutesToHours ( value ); if ( minutes === 0 ) return ` ${ hours } h` ; return ` ${ hours } h ${ minutes } m` ; } return value ; { \"timeDuration\" : \"{{minutes, hoursMinutesDuration}}\" } Conventions Internationalization content can get messy and lead to hard-to-find bugs during translation. As such we strictly follow the below conventions to preserve readability, maintainability, and avoid errors. Organization Keys are organized under top-level objects by how they're used: components defines content used in specific components pages defines content used in specific pages errors defines content used in error messages , which aren\u2019t page or component specific shared defines content shared between multiple components or pages chars defines special characters (such as non-breaking spaces, which are difficult to distinguish in values) Keys are limited to three levels deep, for example pages.claimsDateOfBirth.title . This makes the structure easier to navigate and the process of finding a specific element more consistent. Naming Prioritize readability, and then brevity. Try to be consistent with existing keys. For example the title content for each page should be under a key, pages.<page-identifier>.title . When a page is related to a larger series of pages you can indicate that with a prefix. For example, the name form page within the claims flow is identified as pages.claimsName . Avoid repeating context in the key. For example, prefer pages.claimsName.sectionHint over pages.claimsName.nameSectionHint . Try to name keys after the purpose of the key, not just an underscored version of your translation. This may result in duplication of translations (i.e. multiple keys for \"First name\"), but this is much more flexible for cases down the line when one of those translations needs to change (i.e \"First name\" changes to \"Spouse's first name\"). Keys should be alphabetical so they're easier for others to find and update. We also considered sorting them by page-order where they occur but alphabetical is more easily enforced (with linting) and doesn\u2019t require re-ordering even if content on a page is re-ordered. Keys must be unique - there can't be two keys with the same name. This only applies to the entire key, for example having pages.claimsName.sectionHint and pages.claimsSsn.sectionHint is fine. Common page element terminology The PFML pages follow a design system that uses common terms for various page elements. It's helpful to use these terms when defining content strings for both the developer experience (when implementing a page design this gives you tips on how to name content strings) and in tracing content from the page back to the i18n key. These terms may change over time so this will need to be updated when they do. Some common element terms include: title - one per page sectionLabel - one per section or fieldset. This is typically either an HTML legend or label, depending on the page/section lead - additional context about an entire page, section, or fieldset legend - context about an embedded fieldset (note that sectionLabel content is always called sectionLabel even if we render it with an HTML legend element) label - typically one per input hint - additional context about a specific input Note: we use snake_case for input field names to match the names used by the API, but we don\u2019t carry that over to i18n keys. For example the state_id field on the claims license page has a label called pages.claimsLicense.stateIdLabel . For visual examples of different text elements on a page see the design team\u2019s page template designs. Sharing content All shared keys are located inside the shared object; this makes it obvious that when you're changing one of them your changes will impact multiple components/pages. This is meant to prevent accidental content changes if someone is only trying to update content in one place. Sharing content should follow this pattern: The shared content is defined with a key inside the shared object. Each page or component that uses the shared content should define its own key and reference the shared key. Shared keys, such as shared.claimsPages.leaveTypeTitle , shouldn't be referenced directly in application code. Example shared: { claimsPages: // Define the shared key here -- anyone changing this will know it affects multiple pages takingLeaveTitle: \"Who is taking leave?\", }, } pages: { claimsName: { // Reference the shared content with a key where it's used. This key, `pages.claimsName.title`, // will be the key used within the page. This makes it easy to stop using the shared content // by changing this to a content string. title: \"$t(shared.claimsPages.takingLeaveTitle)\", }, } Using markup in values Sometimes content necessitates the use of specific HTML tags. However, markup should only include tag names and not tag attributes. A tag's className , href , and other attributes should be set by the page or component that renders the key (see usage example below). Using markup in content strings can be useful but it can also make them more difficult to read and edit without introducing errors. Markup should be used sparingly. Some of the reasons for using markup in content strings include answering yes to any of these questions: Does this content require specific embedded tags for formatting? (e.g. <a> , <em> , <strong> , <ul> , <ol> , or multiple <p> tags) Does this content serve one primary function for the user? Is it helpful to edit this content as one key? (e.g. two paragraphs that serve one purpose for the user, or list items with an explicit order) Would breaking this content into multiple keys make them more difficult to name semantically or add unnecessary structure? Rendering values in pages and components Using the useTranslation hook With simple values, you only need to get the t function to render values in the functional component: import React from \"react\" ; import { useTranslation } from \"react-i18next\" ; export function MyComponent () { const { t } = useTranslation (); return < p > { t ( \"translationResourceKey\" )} < /p>; } The Trans component Since the t function can't be used for values that include markup, the Trans component is used to interpolate or translate complex react elements. Set the key in the language file, excluding all tag attributes: htmlKey: \"<ul><li>List item one</li><li>List item two has <my-link>a link</my-link></li></ul>\", Anchors are given a unique tag name in the language file, and the corresponding href value is defined in routes.js : myLink : \"http://www.example.com\" , The Trans component renders the basic tags, br , strong , i , and p . However, other tags must be explicitly defined. The components object is where attributes such as className , href can be set: import React from \"react\" ; import { Trans } from \"react-i18next\" ; < Trans i18nKey = \"htmlKey\" components = {{ \"my-link\" : ( < a target = \"_blank\" rel = \"noopener\" href = { routes . external . myLink } /> ), ul : < ul className = \"usa-list\" /> , li : < li /> , }} />;","title":"Internationalization"},{"location":"portal/internationalization/#internationalization","text":"All Portal internationalization (i18n) is configured in the portal/src/locales/i18n.js module.

New Relic Configuration In order for the New Relic snippet to send data to the correct New Relic Application, we need to set a newRelicAppId environment variable with the New Relic Browser Application ID . We then use the environment variable to configure the New Relic snippet by setting the window.NREUM global variable, in services/tracker.js . \ud83d\udea8 If we ever update the New Relic snippet, we should ensure that the configuration portion at the bottom is removed, so that we're not overwriting window.NREUM.loader_config or window.NREUM.info . Content Security Policy In order for the New Relic script to run, we need to make sure the Content Security Policy set by CloudFront in cloudfront-handler.js allows: Scripts from https://js-agent.newrelic.com/ Scripts from https://bam.nr-data.net/ Correlating Events Across Systems In order to correlate New Relic events and logs between the frontend and backend, we enabled a New Relic feature called Distributed Tracing . This feature is enabled through the JavaScript snippet at the top of new-relic.js . Note that the ability to enable and disable this feature through the Application Settings in the New Relic Browser UI does not actually have any effect, and is therefore not used. In order for Distributed Tracing to work, all of the API environment origins need to be added to the list of allowed_origins at the top of new-relic.js . JS Errors New Relic Browser is used for monitoring JS Errors. JS Errors are reported to New Relic in a variety of ways: When we add a try/catch statement, we should call the newrelic API's noticeError method. For example: try { await doSomething (); } catch ( error ) { tracker . noticeError ( error ); } Our ErrorBoundary component catches any errors that bubble up from its descendant child components The New Relic snippet should automatically catch errors that our React app doesn't catch Errors caught by our ErrorBoundary component are reported to New Relic and also include a componentStack custom attribute, which provides additional information about which component threw the error. New Relic Browser's UI only displays the error's stack trace, so if you want to view the componentStack value, you'll need to use NRQL to query the JavaScriptError : SELECT timestamp , componentStack , stackTrace FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = 'PUT THE APP NAME HERE' Environments Each environment requires its own New Relic Browser \"app\" in order for us to differentiate between data coming in from the different environments.

Overview The primary design pattern used in the Portal is Model-View-Controller , which is the design pattern most commonly used whenever designing any application with a user interface. Data Models Not to be confused with the \"Model\" in Model-View-Controller (MVC), data models represent concepts in the context of the PFML program and the Portal. Data models are used throughout business logic and controller logic, but are not used by lower level View components which should be domain agnostic. Data models should only represent data and not have any business logic or behavior or have any dependencies outside of data models (with the possible exception of simple helper functions). App The App is the \"Controller\" for the application and is the effective entry point to the application as directed by the Nextjs framework. The App controls web application logic, what state to pass to pages, and how to handle application events like submitting claims. Top level application logic should live here. Pages Page components are the primary \"Controller\" unit of the application and represent a single page of the user experience. Page components are the lowest level \"Controller\" in our application (with the exception of more complex View components that have their own nested MVC pattern). Page components control which \"View\" components to render, what state to pass to the components to render, and what event handlers to use to handle \"View\" events. Components Components are the primary \"View\" unit of the application. Simple components simply render data that is passed to them, and exposes events that parent components (the view's controller) can listen to. More complex components can themselves act as controllers and have their own models and nested controllers/views. The QuestionPage component is an example of a more complex component that includes a back button and a \"Save and Continue\" button with onSave and onContinue events that can be listened to. API The API module is reponsible for application-level business logic. This represents the top level \"Model\" in the MVC design pattern. This includes starting claims, submitting claims, identity proofing, setting payment preferences, etc. State Hooks State hooks are modules used by various components to define and update the state of the application. These hooks represent the \"Model\" in the MVC design pattern and should not have any knowledge of controller or view code. An example of a state hook is useFormState . Event Hooks Event hooks are modules that define functions to handle view events. These modules attach view events to the appropriate model update functions, and are the glue that allows us to keep \"Model\" and \"View\" decoupled from each other. Examples of event hooks include useHandleInputChange and useAppLogic . Dependencies To help prevent technical debt, when adding new modules, consider adding assertions to dependencies.test.js to restrict where the module is used, or what dependencies the new module is allowed to have. Services Services expose functionality that offers a coherent feature / addresses a business need (e.g. services/featureFlags.js ). A rule of thumb to use is that services are things that could conceptually be turned into separate microservices. In practice, some of these will actually be served by external services and others will not. Examples include caching, translation/localization, validation, authentication, and any APIs. For example, in our codebase we already have these services: Error monitoring: uses external New Relic API, so this is an \"actual\" service Feature flags: these don't use an external APIs in this implementation but instead just uses the browser APIs (cookies) to accomplish the task. We could conceivably refactor this module to rely on an external API though. For example LaunchDarkly is precisely a product that offers \"feature flags as a service\" but for now we're just using a homegrown \"feature flags service\") Utilities Utilities ( utils ) on the other hand are lightweight functions that are useful but don't really offer any business value on their own. They often fall into the category of filling in gaps of the programming language like manipulating strings or other simple data structures that the language itself doesn't offer functions for, and for which we don't feel the need to introduce a separate library/dependency for. A rule of thumb to use for utilities is that they should be generally small and standalone i.e. they shouldn't have any non-trivial dependencies (like external APIs or large libraries).","title":"Software Architecture"},{"location":"portal/software-architecture/#software-architecture","text":"This page describes the software architecture and design patterns used for the Portal.","title":"Software Architecture"},{"location":"portal/software-architecture/#overview","text":"The primary design pattern used in the Portal is Model-View-Controller , which is the design pattern most commonly used whenever designing any application with a user interface.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"portal/software-architecture/#data-models","text":"Not to be confused with the \"Model\" in Model-View-Controller (MVC), data models represent concepts in the context of the PFML program and the Portal.

It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can preview entire UIs without needing to run the Portal application, or navigating around the Portal flow. You can read more below about the process and collaboration goals behind our usage of Storybook. The ultimate output is a static site that currently gets deployed here . (Related: Deploy docs ) Contributing to Storybook First: The Storybook docs are great. If your question isn't answered in this doc, it's likely answered in their docs. This doc is more of a TLDR to get you started contributing to our Storybook. Developers can run Storybook locally by running: npm run docs Adding a new story Each page in Storybook is generated from *.stories.tsx files located in portal/storybook/stories/ . This file exports functions ( \"stories\" ), each of which is rendered on the page. The functions can render any arbitrary React, so a Story can render a page, component, or plain HTML. For example, here's a Storybook page with a single story that renders a preview of our Button component: // portal/storybook/stories/components/Button.stories.tsx import Button from \"src/components/Button\"; import React from \"react\"; import { Props } from \"types/common\"; export default { // this determines where the story shows in the site's sidebar menu: title: \"Components/Button\", // this is used to generate the props table on the page: component: Button, // these are passed into each story and enable nifty // live editing in the site's UI: args: { children: \"Save and continue\", handleClick: () => alert(\"Clicked!\"), }, }; export const Primary = (args: Props<typeof Button>) => { return <Button {...args} />; }; Learn more about writing stories \u2192 Learn more about Storybook args and argTypes , which we use for providing prop and state controls in the Storybook UI. Previewing entire pages In Next.js, a page is just a React component . This enables some pretty cool capabilities when combined with Storybook. Specifically, this means we can create a Story that renders a Page component, which allows us to preview an entire page without navigating through the entire application flow to preview the page. An additional benefit of including a Story for a Page component is that this page will receive an automated accessibility scan as part of the tests generated for each story. Application flow For the \"Create Application\" claimant flow, we're generating a Storybook page for each page in the flow . Engineers can override the generated story by adding a *.stories.tsx file for the page in the storybook/stories/pages/applications directory. How Storybook interacts with our source code Storybook stories import and render the same components used in the live site. Below is a visualization attempting to demonstrate how assets are shared between our web application and the Storybook site. For engineers For the engineering team, Storybook provides a place to document components and also provides a place outside of our Next.js app to preview new components being developed. For engineers, Storybook aims to answer questions like: What components exist? How does this component behave when rendered? What is this component for? What props does this component expect? Engineers could also look at the source code to answer most of these questions, but Storybook provides a friendly UI to answer them. It also provides a mechanism for producing smaller pull requests \u2014 for instance, rather than creating a component and connecting it to our application logic, an engineer could first create a pull request that adds just the component and a corresponding Storybook story for previewing the component. For designers There's also a world where Storybook can be used as a shared tool, supporting a more collaborative workflow between Engineering, Design, and Product teams. One goal is to have a source of truth for design pattern documentation and guidance. Ideally that lives close to the actual implementation of the patterns. The goals for Storybook in this case would be to answer the questions above, as well as questions like: Why does this design pattern exist? What problems is it addressing? What does this design pattern look like at different screen sizes? What have we learned about this pattern through user research? How has it evolved? This may mean that some Storybook pages are more in-depth than others. These more extensive documentation pages would be a collaboration between Engineering and Design. Engineering's role might be: code the components and setup the Storybook page with an example of the component. It would then be Design's role to contribute design documentation, like any decisions or research that fed into the creation of the pattern, or guidance on different ways the component should be used.

We also use jest-dom custom matchers. Read the Jest documentation to learn how to write assertions. A good place to start if you are new to JS testing is to learn about Using Matchers . Below is an example of a test: import sum from \"./sum\" ; describe ( \"sum\" , () => { it ( \"adds 1 + 2 to equal 3\" , () => { const result = sum ( 1 , 2 ); expect ( result ). toBe ( 3 ); }); }); Creating new test files A test file should be placed in the appropriate tests directory (e.g. portal/tests ) rather than alongside the file it tests. These test files should have the same name as the file they're testing, and have .test.tsx as the extension. For example, pages/index.tsx and tests/pages/index.test.tsx . You'll notice some existing test files written in .js . These were created before we migrated the codebase to TypeScript. We recommend that any new tests be written in TypeScript, in order to reduce the introduction of more .js files into the codebase. Unit tests We use React Testing Library alongside Jest. React Testing Library (RTL), enables us to interact with rendered DOM nodes directly in our tests. This helps us to write tests that resemble the way our software is used (more on that in the RTL guiding principles ). React Testing Library Resources: React Testing Library Docs Cheatsheet guide to reference all the available React Testing Library fucntions Playground to test out your queries Below is an example of a React component test: import { fireEvent , render , screen } from \"@testing-library/react\" ; import Button from \"./Button\" ; describe ( \"Button\" , () => { it ( \"is clickable\" , () => { const onClickHandler = jest . fn (); render ( < Button onClick = { onClickHandler } > Click me < /Button>); fireEvent . click ( screen . getByText ( /Click me/ )); expect ( onClickHandler ). toHaveBeenCalled (); }); }); Snapshot tests Snapshot tests are useful for testing when a React component or JSON output changes unexpectedly. A typical snapshot test case is to render a UI component, take a snapshot, then compares it to the last snapshot that was taken. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match. If a snapshot test fails, you should identify whether it failed because the change was unexpected. If it was an unexpected change, then you may have unintentionally broke an expected behavior, in which case you should investigate and fix it before sending the PR out for review. If it failed because you intentionally changed something related to the test, then the snapshot should be updated to reflect the intended change. To update snapshots, run: npm run test:update-snapshots Learn more about Snapshot Testing. JSON snapshot example it ( \"renders the fields with the expected content and attributes\" , () => { const output = callMethodAndReturnJSON (); // You can use inline snapshots if the output is fairly short: expect ( output ). toMatchInlineSnapshot (); }); React snapshot example it ( \"renders the component as expected\" , () => { const { container } = render ( < ExampleComponent /> ); expect ( container . firstChild ). toMatchSnapshot (); }); Mocks Mock functions make it easy to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values. The quickest way to mock a module is to call jest.mock('MODULE_NAME_HERE') at the top of your test file. To create a manual mock of a Node module, create a file in a top-level __mocks__ directory. You can also create a Mock function/spy using jest.fn() Learn more about Mock Functions . Test coverage Jest includes built-in support for measuring test coverage , using Istanbul . The coverageReporters Jest setting can be modified for more advanced test coverage use cases. Storybook and Accessibility tests A test is generated for each story in the Storybook. The test asserts: The story renders without crashing The story has no accessibility violations. Accessibility tests We use jest-axe to run automated accessibility tests. You shouldn't rely heavily on these tests. The Accessibility team from the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) found that only ~30% of issues are found by automated testing . For the most part, you can rely on the generated Storybook test to run the accessibility tests. The error reports can sometimes make it difficult to identify what aspect of the page it's referring to. In these cases, it can be easier to view the Accessibility tab in the Storybook UI, where you can then toggle highlighting of the offending element(s): If you want to introduce a unique test that's not dependent on Storybook, you can add your own accessibility assertion. For example: // tests/pages/index.test.tsx import Page from \"src/pages/index\"; import { axe } from \"jest-axe\"; import { render } from \"@testing-library/react\"; it(\"renders page without accessibility violations\", async () => { const { container } = render(<Page />); const results = await axe(container); expect(results).toHaveNoViolations(); });","title":"Tests"},{"location":"portal/tests/#tests","text":"","title":"Tests"},{"location":"portal/tests/#introduction","text":"Jest is used as our JS test runner and is very similar to Jasmine.

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. The TypeScript landing page does a good job of describing TypeScript, and how it relates to JavaScript. Give it a scroll. Portal was originally written in JavaScript and later migrated to TypeScript in October 2021. You can reference the original migration tech spec in Confluence for additional context. Conventions and norms Use interface instead of class for data models that have no getters, setters, or default values. This simplifies the code and results in less compiled JavaScript. Portal data models should match the API's. For example, if an API model indicates a field is nullable / Optional , the corresponding Portal data model should reflect the field can be null as well. Our type declarations should be as narrow as possible however, and we should be comfortable questioning if an API data model field is truly ever empty in reality. View the API's schema here View an overview of the API DB models here Explicitly declaring function return types is encouraged . This helps make the engineer's intent clear. We're not currently enforcing this with a lint rule , since this can produce a lot of noise due to React functional components and hooks. It's solvable, but was deprioritized during the initial TypeScript migration effort. Avoid TypeScript features that produce different JS code when compiled when there is a suitable alternative. For example, we avoid using TypeScript's enum and parameter properties . Lint rules are configured to prevent those two particular examples. Why? \u2935\ufe0f TypeScript is supposed to be JavaScript, but with static type features added. If we remove all of the types from TypeScript code, what's left should be valid JavaScript code. The formal word used in the TypeScript documentation is \"type-level extension\": most TypeScript features are type-level extensions to JavaScript, but they don't affect the code's runtime behavior. Unfortunately, TypeScript's solution is to break its own rule in this case [for enums]. When compiling an enum, the compiler adds extra JavaScript code that never existed in the original TypeScript code. There are very few TypeScript features like this. Each of these unusual features adds a confusing complication to the otherwise simple TypeScript compiler model. \u2014 Execute Program's TypeScript course. Tricky errors & solutions Writing boolean expressions The strict-boolean-expressions lint rule is enforced, and can be confusing when initially encountered. Before this rule, we could (and did) have conditions that would check if a number was set, for instance: const size : number = props . size ; const className = size ? `margin- ${ size } ` : \"margin-5\" ; A bug is present in that example, because 0 is falsey in JavaScript, so if size was 0 , className would be margin-5 (the fallback) instead of margin-0 . With the lint rule, this is now an error indicating: Unexpected nullable number value in conditional. Please handle the nullish/zero/NaN cases explicitly. You can now fix the lint error with a few approaches. Nullish coalescing : const className = `margin- ${ size ?? 5 } ` ; Using the isBlank utility: const className = isBlank ( size ) ? \"margin-5\" : `margin- ${ size } ` ; Handling null/undefined values null and undefined have their own distinct types and you\u2019ll get a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected. For example with this TypeScript code, users.find has no guarantee that it will actually find a user, but you can write code as though it will: declare const loggedInUsername : string ; const users = [ { name : \"Oby\" , age : 12 }, { name : \"Heera\" , age : 32 }, ]; const loggedInUser = users . find (( u ) => u . name === loggedInUsername ); console . log ( loggedInUser . age ); You'll receive an error that you have not made a guarantee that the loggedInUser exists before trying to use it. One approach to solving this is to use the optional chaining operator : console . log ( loggedInUser ? . age ); This behavior is due to strictNullChecks . Narrowing an object's type TypeScript supports narrowing objects by using the in operator . For example: interface ErrorWithIssues { issues : string []; } interface BlankError {} function handleError ( error : ErrorWithIssues | BlankError ) { if ( \"issues\" in error ) { // We've now narrowed error down to ErrorWithIssues console . error ( error . issues . join ( \",\" )); } else { // We've now narrowed error down to BlankError console . error ( \"Generic error occurred\" ); } } Learning TypeScript Crash courses and references TypeScript Handbook TypeScript Playground React TypeScript Cheatsheets More in depth course material Execute Program Effective TypeScript","title":"TypeScript"},{"location":"portal/typescript/#typescript","text":"Portal's source code is written in TypeScript .

Using the Google Analytics ga function isn't recommended when using Google Tag Manager. Environment Configuration Each Portal environment should have a corresponding Google Tag Manager environment. Once a Google Tag Manager environment exists, we need to set the Portal gtmConfigAuth and gtmConfigPreview environment variables based on that Google Tag Manager environment's values. You can find these values through the Google Tag Manager website in the Admin section by navigating to the environment and looking at the JavaScript snippet for that environment. Look for a URL with gtm_auth and gtm_preview query parameters. The values for those query parameters should be set as the corresponding Portal environment variables.
